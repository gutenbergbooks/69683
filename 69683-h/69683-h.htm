<div><h1 id='ch1'>THE UNDEFEATED</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Manuel Garcia</span> climbed the stairs to Don
Miguel Retana’s office. He set down his suitcase
and knocked on the door. There was no
answer. Manuel, standing in the hallway, felt
there was some one in the room. He felt it
through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Retana,” he said, listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’s there, all right, Manuel thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Retana,” he said and banged the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” said some one in the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, Manolo,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” asked the voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to work,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the door clicked several times
and it swung open. Manuel went in, carrying
his suitcase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little man sat behind a desk at the far side
of the room. Over his head was a bull’s head,
stuffed by a Madrid taxidermist; on the walls
were framed photographs and bull-fight posters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man sat looking at Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought they’d killed you,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel knocked with his knuckles on the
desk. The little man sat looking at him across
the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many corridas you had this year?”
Retana asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that one?” the little man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I read about it in the papers,” Retana said.
He leaned back in the chair and looked at Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel looked up at the stuffed bull. He
had seen it often before. He felt a certain
family interest in it. It had killed his brother,
the promising one, about nine years ago. Manuel
remembered the day. There was a brass
plate on the oak shield the bull’s head was
mounted on. Manuel could not read it, but
he imagined it was in memory of his brother.
Well, he had been a good kid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plate said: “The Bull ‘Mariposa’ of the
Duke of Veragua, which accepted 9 varas for 7
caballos, and caused the death of Antonio Garcia,
Novillero, April 27, 1909.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana saw him looking at the stuffed bull’s
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lot the Duke sent me for Sunday will
make a scandal,” he said. “They’re all bad in
the legs. What do they say about them at the
Café?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Manuel said. “I just got
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Retana said. “You still have your
bag.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Manuel, leaning back behind
the big desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” he said. “Take off your cap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel sat down; his cap off, his face was
changed. He looked pale, and his coleta pinned
forward on his head, so that it would not show
under the cap, gave him a strange look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t look well,” Retana said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just got out of the hospital,” Manuel
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard they’d cut your leg off,” Retana
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Manuel. “It got all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana leaned forward across the desk and
pushed a wooden box of cigarettes toward Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a cigarette,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel lit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smoke?” he said, offering the match to
Retana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Retana waved his hand, “I never
smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana watched him smoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you get a job and go to work?”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to work,” Manuel said. “I
am a bull-fighter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There aren’t any bull-fighters any more,”
Retana said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a bull-fighter,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, while you’re in there,” Retana said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana sat, saying nothing and looking at
Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll put you in a nocturnal if you want,”
Retana offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” Manuel asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to substitute for anybody,” Manuel
said. That was the way they all got killed.
That was the way Salvador got killed. He
tapped with his knuckles on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all I’ve got,” Retana said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you put me on next week?”
Manuel suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t draw,” Retana said. “All
they want is Litri and Rubito and La Torre.
Those kids are good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’d come to see me get it,” Manuel said,
hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they wouldn’t. They don’t know who
you are any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got a lot of stuff,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m offering to put you on to-morrow
night,” Retana said. “You can work with
young Hernandez and kill two novillos after
the Chariots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose novillos?” Manuel asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Whatever stuff they’ve got
in the corrals. What the veterinaries won’t
pass in the daytime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to substitute,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can take it or leave it,” Retana said.
He leaned forward over the papers. He was
no longer interested. The appeal that Manuel
had made to him for a moment when he
thought of the old days was gone. He would
like to get him to substitute for Larita because
he could get him cheaply. He could get others
cheaply too. He would like to help him though.
Still he had given him the chance. It was up
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do I get?” Manuel asked. He
was still playing with the idea of refusing. But
he knew he could not refuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two hundred and fifty pesetas,” Retana
said. He had thought of five hundred, but
when he opened his mouth it said two hundred
and fifty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You pay Villalta seven thousand,” Manuel
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not Villalta,” Retana said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He draws it, Manolo,” Retana said in explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said Manuel. He stood up. “Give
me three hundred, Retana.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Retana agreed. He reached in
the drawer for a paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I have fifty now?” Manuel asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said Retana. He took a fifty peseta
note out of his pocket-book and laid it, spread
out flat, on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel picked it up and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about a cuadrilla?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the boys that always work for me
nights,” Retana said. “They’re all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about picadors?” Manuel asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not much,” Retana admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to have one good pic,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get him then,” Retana said. “Go and get
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not out of this,” Manuel said. “I’m not
paying for any cuadrilla out of sixty duros.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel
across the big desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I’ve got to have one good pic,”
Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana said nothing but looked at Manuel
from a long way off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t right,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana was still considering him, leaning
back in his chair, considering him from a long
way away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’re the regular pics,” he offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” Manuel said. “I know your regular
pics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana did not smile. Manuel knew it was
over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I want is an even break,” Manuel said
reasoningly. “When I go out there I want to
be able to call my shots on the bull. It only
takes one good picador.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was talking to a man who was no longer
listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want something extra,” Retana said,
“go and get it. There will be a regular cuadrilla
out there. Bring as many of your own
pics as you want. The charlotada is over by
10.30.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Manuel said. “If that’s the way
you feel about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way,” Retana said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see you to-morrow night,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be out there,” Retana said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel picked up his suitcase and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut the door,” Retana called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel looked back. Retana was sitting forward
looking at some papers. Manuel pulled
the door tight until it clicked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went down the stairs and out of the door
into the hot brightness of the street. It was
very hot in the street and the light on the white
buildings was sudden and hard on his eyes. He
walked down the shady side of the steep street
toward the Puerta del Sol. The shade felt solid
and cool as running water. The heat came suddenly
as he crossed the intersecting streets.
Manuel saw no one he knew in all the people he
passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before the Puerta del Sol he turned into
a café.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quiet in the café. There were a few
men sitting at tables against the wall. At one
table four men played cards. Most of the men
sat against the wall smoking, empty coffee-cups
and liqueur-glasses before them on the tables.
Manuel went through the long room to a small
room in back. A man sat at a table in the corner
asleep. Manuel sat down at one of the
tables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A waiter came in and stood beside Manuel’s
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen Zurito?” Manuel asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was in before lunch,” the waiter answered.
“He won’t be back before five o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me some coffee and milk and a shot
of the ordinary,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter came back into the room carrying
a tray with a big coffee-glass and a liqueur-glass
on it. In his left hand he held a bottle of
brandy. He swung these down to the table
and a boy who had followed him poured coffee
and milk into the glass from two shiny, spouted
pots with long handles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel took off his cap and the waiter noticed
his pigtail pinned forward on his head.
He winked at the coffee-boy as he poured out
the brandy into the little glass beside Manuel’s
coffee. The coffee-boy looked at Manuel’s pale
face curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fighting here?” asked the waiter, corking
up the bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Manuel said. “To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter stood there, holding the bottle on
one hip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You in the Charlie Chaplins?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coffee-boy looked away, embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. In the ordinary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought they were going to have Chaves
and Hernandez,” the waiter said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Me and another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who? Chaves or Hernandez?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hernandez, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with Chaves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He got hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you hear that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Retana.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Looie,” the waiter called to the next
room, “Chaves got cogida.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel had taken the wrapper off the lumps
of sugar and dropped them into his coffee. He
stirred it and drank it down, sweet, hot, and
warming in his empty stomach. He drank off
the brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me another shot of that,” he said to
the waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter uncorked the bottle and poured
the glass full, slopping another drink into the
saucer. Another waiter had come up in front of
the table. The coffee-boy was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Chaves hurt bad?” the second waiter
asked Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Manuel said, “Retana didn’t
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hell of a lot he cares,” the tall waiter said.
Manuel had not seen him before. He must
have just come up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you stand in with Retana in this town,
you’re a made man,” the tall waiter said. “If
you aren’t in with him, you might just as well
go out and shoot yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it,” the other waiter who had come
in said. “You said it then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right I said it,” said the tall waiter.
“I know what I’m talking about when I talk
about that bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look what he’s done for Villalta,” the first
waiter said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that ain’t all,” the tall waiter said.
“Look what he’s done for Marcial Lalanda.
Look what he’s done for Nacional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it, kid,” agreed the short waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel looked at them, standing talking in
front of his table. He had drunk his second
brandy. They had forgotten about him. They
were not interested in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at that bunch of camels,” the tall
waiter went on. “Did you ever see this Nacional
II?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seen him last Sunday didn’t I?” the original
waiter said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a giraffe,” the short waiter said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I tell you?” the tall waiter said.
“Those are Retana’s boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, give me another shot of that,” Manuel
said. He had poured the brandy the waiter had
slopped over in the saucer into his glass and
drank it while they were talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original waiter poured his glass full
mechanically, and the three of them went out
of the room talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the far corner the man was still asleep,
snoring slightly on the intaking breath, his head
back against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel drank his brandy. He felt sleepy
himself. It was too hot to go out into the town.
Besides there was nothing to do. He wanted
to see Zurito. He would go to sleep while he
waited. He kicked his suitcase under the table
to be sure it was there. Perhaps it would be
better to put it back under the seat, against the
wall. He leaned down and shoved it under.
Then he leaned forward on the table and went
to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he woke there was some one sitting
across the table from him. It was a big man
with a heavy brown face like an Indian. He
had been sitting there some time. He had
waved the waiter away and sat reading the
paper and occasionally looking down at Manuel,
asleep, his head on the table. He read the paper
laboriously, forming the words with his lips as
he read. When it tired him he looked at Manuel.
He sat heavily in the chair, his black Cordoba
hat tipped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel sat up and looked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Zurito,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, kid,” the big man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been asleep.” Manuel rubbed his forehead
with the back of his fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought maybe you were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. How is everything with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both silent. Zurito, the picador,
looked at Manuel’s white face. Manuel looked
down at the picador’s enormous hands folding
the paper to put away in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a favor to ask you, Manos,” Manuel
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manosduros was Zurito’s nickname. He
never heard it without thinking of his huge
hands. He put them forward on the table
self-consciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have a drink,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter came and went and came again.
He went out of the room looking back at the
two men at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, Manolo?” Zurito set
down his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you pic two bulls for me to-morrow
night?” Manuel asked, looking up at Zurito
across the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Zurito. “I’m not pic-ing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel looked down at his glass. He had
expected that answer; now he had it. Well, he
had it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Manolo, but I’m not pic-ing.”
Zurito looked at his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m too old,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just asked you,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it the nocturnal to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it. I figured if I had just one good
pic, I could get away with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much are you getting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three hundred pesetas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I get more than that for pic-ing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Manuel. “I didn’t have any
right to ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you keep on doing it for?” Zurito
asked. “Why don’t you cut off your coleta,
Manolo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re pretty near as old as I am,” Zurito
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Manuel said. “I got to do
it. If I can fix it so that I get an even break,
that’s all I want. I got to stick with it, Manos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do. I’ve tried keeping away from
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know how you feel. But it isn’t right.
You ought to get out and stay out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t do it. Besides, I’ve been going good
lately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito looked at his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been in the hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I was going great when I got hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito said nothing. He tipped the cognac
out of his saucer into his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The papers said they never saw a better
faena,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito looked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know when I get going I’m good,”
Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re too old,” the picador said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Manuel. “You’re ten years older
than I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With me it’s different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not too old,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat silent, Manuel watching the picador’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going great till I got hurt,” Manuel
offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have seen me, Manos,” Manuel
said, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to see you,” Zurito said. “It
makes me nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t seen me lately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen you plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito looked at Manuel, avoiding his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to quit it, Manolo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” Manuel said. “I’m going good
now, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito leaned forward, his hands on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen. I’ll pic for you and if you don’t go
big to-morrow night, you’ll quit. See? Will
you do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito leaned back, relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got to quit,” he said. “No monkey
business. You got to cut the coleta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t have to quit,” Manuel said. “You
watch me. I’ve got the stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito stood up. He felt tired from arguing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got to quit,” he said. “I’ll cut your
coleta myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you won’t,” Manuel said. “You won’t
have a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito called the waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” said Zurito. “Come on up to
the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel reached under the seat for his suitcase.
He was happy. He knew Zurito would
pic for him. He was the best picador living.
It was all simple now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on up to the house and we’ll eat,”
Zurito said.</p>

<hr class='tbk'>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel stood in the patio de caballos waiting
for the Charlie Chaplins to be over. Zurito
stood beside him. Where they stood it was
dark. The high door that led into the bull-ring
was shut. Above them they heard a shout,
then another shout of laughter. Then there
was silence. Manuel liked the smell of the
stables about the patio de caballos. It smelt
good in the dark. There was another roar from
the arena and then applause, prolonged applause,
going on and on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ever seen these fellows?” Zurito asked,
big and looming beside Manuel in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re pretty funny.” Zurito said. He
smiled to himself in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The high, double, tight-fitting door into the
bull-ring swung open and Manuel saw the ring
in the hard light of the arc-lights, the plaza,
dark all the way around, rising high; around
the edge of the ring were running and bowing
two men dressed like tramps, followed by a
third in the uniform of a hotel bell-boy who
stooped and picked up the hats and canes thrown
down onto the sand and tossed them back up
into the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The electric light went on in the patio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll climb onto one of those ponies while
you collect the kids,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind them came the jingle of the mules,
coming out to go into the arena and be hitched
onto the dead bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of the cuadrilla, who had been
watching the burlesque from the runway between
the barrera and the seats, came walking
back and stood in a group talking, under the
electric light in the patio. A good-looking lad
in a silver-and-orange suit came up to Manuel
and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m Hernandez,” he said and put out his
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel shook it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re regular elephants we’ve got to-night,”
the boy said cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re big ones with horns,” Manuel
agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You drew the worst lot,” the boy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” Manuel said. “The bigger
they are, the more meat for the poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you get that one?” Hernandez
grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s an old one,” Manuel said. “You
line up your cuadrilla, so I can see what I’ve
got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got some good kids,” Hernandez
said. He was very cheerful. He had been on
twice before in nocturnals and was beginning
to get a following in Madrid. He was happy
the fight would start in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the pics?” Manuel asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re back in the corrals fighting about
who gets the beautiful horses,” Hernandez
grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mules came through the gate in a rush,
the whips snapping, bells jangling and the
young bull ploughing a furrow of sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They formed up for the paseo as soon as the
bull had gone through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel and Hernandez stood in front. The
youths of the cuadrillas were behind, their
heavy capes furled over their arms. In back,
the four picadors, mounted, holding their steel-tipped
push-poles erect in the half-dark of the
corral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a wonder Retana wouldn’t give us
enough light to see the horses by,” one picador
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows we’ll be happier if we don’t get
too good a look at these skins,” another pic answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This thing I’m on barely keeps me off the
ground,” the first picador said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’re horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, they’re horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked, sitting their gaunt horses in the
dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito said nothing. He had the only steady
horse of the lot. He had tried him, wheeling
him in the corrals and he responded to the bit
and the spurs. He had taken the bandage off
his right eye and cut the strings where they had
tied his ears tight shut at the base. He was a
good, solid horse, solid on his legs. That was
all he needed. He intended to ride him all
through the corrida. He had already, since he
had mounted, sitting in the half-dark in the
big, quilted saddle, waiting for the paseo, pic-ed
through the whole corrida in his mind. The
other picadors went on talking on both sides of
him. He did not hear them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two matadors stood together in front of
their three peones, their capes furled over their
left arms in the same fashion. Manuel was
thinking about the three lads in back of him.
They were all three Madrileños, like Hernandez,
boys about nineteen. One of them, a
gypsy, serious, aloof, and dark-faced, he liked
the look of. He turned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your name, kid?” he asked the
gypsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fuentes,” the gypsy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good name,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gypsy smiled, showing his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take the bull and give him a little run
when he comes out,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” the gypsy said. His face was
serious. He began to think about just what he
would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here she goes,” Manuel said to Hernandez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. We’ll go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heads up, swinging with the music, their
right arms swinging free, they stepped out,
crossing the sanded arena under the arc-lights,
the cuadrillas opening out behind, the picadors
riding after, behind came the bull-ring servants
and the jingling mules. The crowd applauded
Hernandez as they marched across the arena.
Arrogant, swinging, they looked straight ahead
as they marched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bowed before the president, and the
procession broke up into its component parts.
The bull-fighters went over to the barrera and
changed their heavy mantles for the light fighting
capes. The mules went out. The picadors
galloped jerkily around the ring, and two rode
out the gate they had come in by. The servants
swept the sand smooth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel drank a glass of water poured for
him by one of Retana’s deputies, who was acting
as his manager and sword-handler. Hernandez
came over from speaking with his own manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got a good hand, kid,” Manuel complimented
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They like me,” Hernandez said happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did the paseo go?” Manuel asked
Retana’s man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a wedding,” said the handler. “Fine.
You came out like Joselito and Belmonte.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito rode by, a bulky equestrian statue. He
wheeled his horse and faced him toward the
toril on the far side of the ring where the bull
would come out. It was strange under the arc-light.
He pic-ed in the hot afternoon sun for
big money. He didn’t like this arc-light business.
He wished they would get started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel went up to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pic him, Manos,” he said. “Cut him down
to size for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll pic him, kid,” Zurito spat on the sand.
“I’ll make him jump out of the ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lean on him, Manos,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll lean on him,” Zurito said. “What’s
holding it up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s coming now,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito sat there, his feet in the box-stirrups,
his great legs in the buckskin-covered armor
gripping the horse, the reins in his left hand,
the long pic held in his right hand, his broad
hat well down over his eyes to shade them from
the lights, watching the distant door of the toril.
His horse’s ears quivered. Zurito patted him
with his left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red door of the toril swung back and for
a moment Zurito looked into the empty passageway
far across the arena. Then the bull came
out in a rush, skidding on his four legs as he
came out under the lights, then charging in a
gallop, moving softly in a fast gallop, silent
except as he woofed through wide nostrils as he
charged, glad to be free after the dark pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first row of seats, slightly bored, leaning
forward to write on the cement wall in front
of his knees, the substitute bull-fight critic of
<span class='it'>El Heraldo</span> scribbled: “Campagnero, Negro,
42, came out at 90 miles an hour with plenty of
gas——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel, leaning against the barrera, watching
the bull, waved his hand and the gypsy ran
out, trailing his cape. The bull, in full gallop,
pivoted and charged the cape, his head down,
his tail rising. The gypsy moved in a zigzag,
and as he passed, the bull caught sight of him
and abandoned the cape to charge the man. The
gyp sprinted and vaulted the red fence of the
barrera as the bull struck it with his horns. He
tossed into it twice with his horns, banging into
the wood blindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The critic of <span class='it'>El Heraldo</span> lit a cigarette and
tossed the match at the bull, then wrote in his
note-book, “large and with enough horns to satisfy
the cash customers, Campagnero showed a
tendency to cut into the terrane of the bull-fighters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel stepped out on the hard sand as the
bull banged into the fence. Out of the corner
of his eye he saw Zurito sitting the white horse
close to the barrera, about a quarter of the way
around the ring to the left. Manuel held the
cape close in front of him, a fold in each hand,
and shouted at the bull. “Huh! Huh!” The
bull turned, seemed to brace against the fence
as he charged in a scramble, driving into the
cape as Manuel side-stepped, pivoted on his
heels with the charge of the bull, and swung the
cape just ahead of the horns. At the end of
the swing he was facing the bull again and held
the cape in the same position close in front of
his body, and pivoted again as the bull recharged.
Each time, as he swung, the crowd
shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four times he swung with the bull, lifting
the cape so it billowed full, and each time bringing
the bull around to charge again. Then, at
the end of the fifth swing, he held the cape
against his hip and pivoted, so the cape swung
out like a ballet dancer’s skirt and wound the
bull around himself like a belt, to step clear,
leaving the bull facing Zurito on the white
horse, come up and planted firm, the horse facing
the bull, its ears forward, its lips nervous,
Zurito, his hat over his eyes, leaning forward,
the long pole sticking out before and behind in
a sharp angle under his right arm, held half-way
down, the triangular iron point facing the
bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>El Heraldo’s</span> second-string critic, drawing on
his cigarette, his eyes on the bull, wrote: “the
veteran Manolo designed a series of acceptable
veronicas, ending in a very Belmontistic recorte
that earned applause from the regulars, and we
entered the tercio of the cavalry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito sat his horse, measuring the distance
between the bull and the end of the pic. As he
looked, the bull gathered himself together and
charged, his eyes on the horse’s chest. As he
lowered his head to hook, Zurito sunk the point
of the pic in the swelling hump of muscle above
the bull’s shoulder, leaned all his weight on
the shaft, and with his left hand pulled the
white horse into the air, front hoofs pawing,
and swung him to the right as he pushed the
bull under and through so the horns passed
safely under the horse’s belly and the horse
came down, quivering, the bull’s tail brushing
his chest as he charged the cape Hernandez offered
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hernandez ran sideways, taking the bull out
and away with the cape, toward the other picador.
He fixed him with a swing of the cape,
squarely facing the horse and rider, and stepped
back. As the bull saw the horse he charged.
The picador’s lance slid along his back, and as
the shock of the charge lifted the horse, the
picador was already half-way out of the saddle,
lifting his right leg clear as he missed
with the lance and falling to the left side to
keep the horse between him and the bull. The
horse, lifted and gored, crashed over with the
bull driving into him, the picador gave a shove
with his boots against the horse and lay clear,
waiting to be lifted and hauled away and put
on his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel let the bull drive into the fallen
horse; he was in no hurry, the picador was safe;
besides, it did a picador like that good to worry.
He’d stay on longer next time. Lousy pics! He
looked across the sand at Zurito a little way
out from the barrera, his horse rigid, waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” he called to the bull, “Tomar!”
holding the cape in both hands so it would catch
his eye. The bull detached himself from the
horse and charged the cape, and Manuel, running
sideways and holding the cape spread wide,
stopped, swung on his heels, and brought the
bull sharply around facing Zurito.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Campagnero accepted a pair of varas for the
death of one rosinante, with Hernandez and
Manolo at the quites,” <span class='it'>El Heraldo’s</span> critic wrote.
“He pressed on the iron and clearly showed he
was no horse-lover. The veteran Zurito resurrected
some of his old stuff with the pike-pole,
notably the suerte——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Olé Olé!” the man sitting beside him
shouted. The shout was lost in the roar of the
crowd, and he slapped the critic on the back.
The critic looked up to see Zurito, directly below
him, leaning far out over his horse, the
length of the pic rising in a sharp angle under
his armpit, holding the pic almost by the point,
bearing down with all his weight, holding the
bull off, the bull pushing and driving to get at
the horse, and Zurito, far out, on top of him,
holding him, holding him, and slowly pivoting
the horse against the pressure, so that at
last he was clear. Zurito felt the moment when
the horse was clear and the bull could come
past, and relaxed the absolute steel lock of
his resistance, and the triangular steel point of
the pic ripped in the bull’s hump of shoulder
muscle as he tore loose to find Hernandez’s
cape before his muzzle. He charged blindly
into the cape and the boy took him out into the
open arena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito sat patting his horse and looking at the
bull charging the cape that Hernandez swung
for him out under the bright light while the
crowd shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see that one?” he said to Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a wonder,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got him that time,” Zurito said. “Look
at him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the conclusion of a closely turned pass of
the cape the bull slid to his knees. He was up
at once, but far out across the sand Manuel and
Zurito saw the shine of the pumping flow of
blood, smooth against the black of the bull’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got him that time,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a good bull,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they gave me another shot at him, I’d
kill him,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll change the thirds on us,” Manuel
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at him now,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got to go over there,” Manuel said, and
started on a run for the other side of the ring,
where the monos were leading a horse out by
the bridle toward the bull, whacking him on the
legs with rods and all, in a procession, trying to
get him toward the bull, who stood, dropping
his head, pawing, unable to make up his mind
to charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito, sitting his horse, walking him toward
the scene, not missing any detail, scowled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally the bull charged, the horse leaders
ran for the barrera, the picador hit too far back,
and the bull got under the horse, lifted him,
threw him onto his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito watched. The monos, in their red
shirts, running out to drag the picador clear.
The picador, now on his feet, swearing and flopping
his arms. Manuel and Hernandez standing
ready with their capes. And the bull, the
great, black bull, with a horse on his back,
hooves dangling, the bridle caught in the horns.
Black bull with a horse on his back, staggering
short-legged, then arching his neck and lifting,
thrusting, charging to slide the horse off, horse
sliding down. Then the bull into a lunging
charge at the cape Manuel spread for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull was slower now, Manuel felt. He
was bleeding badly. There was a sheen of
blood all down his flank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel offered him the cape again. There
he came, eyes open, ugly, watching the cape.
Manuel stepped to the side and raised his arms,
tightening the cape ahead of the bull for the
veronica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now he was facing the bull. Yes, his head
was going down a little. He was carrying it
lower. That was Zurito.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel flopped the cape; there he comes; he
side-stepped and swung in another veronica.
He’s shooting awfully accurately, he thought.
He’s had enough fight, so he’s watching now.
He’s hunting now. Got his eye on me. But I
always give him the cape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook the cape at the bull; there he
comes; he side-stepped. Awful close that time.
I don’t want to work that close to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The edge of the cape was wet with blood
where it had swept along the bull’s back as he
went by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All right, here’s the last one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel, facing the bull, having turned with
him each charge, offered the cape with his two
hands. The bull looked at him. Eyes watching,
horns straight forward, the bull looked at
him, watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh!” Manuel said, “Toro!” and leaning
back, swung the cape forward. Here he comes.
He side-stepped, swung the cape in back of him,
and pivoted, so the bull followed a swirl of
cape and then was left with nothing, fixed by
the pass, dominated by the cape. Manuel swung
the cape under his muzzle with one hand, to
show the bull was fixed, and walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no applause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel walked across the sand toward the
barrera, while Zurito rode out of the ring. The
trumpet had blown to change the act to the
planting of the banderillos while Manuel had
been working with the bull. He had not consciously
noticed it. The monos were spreading
canvas over the two dead horses and sprinkling
sawdust around them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel came up to the barrera for a drink of
water. Retana’s man handed him the heavy
porous jug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuentes, the tall gypsy, was standing holding
a pair of banderillos, holding them together,
slim, red sticks, fish-hook points out. He looked
at Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on out there,” Manuel said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gypsy trotted out. Manuel set down
the jug and watched. He wiped his face with
his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The critic of <span class='it'>El Heraldo</span> reached for the bottle
of warm champagne that stood between his
feet, took a drink, and finished his paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—the aged Manolo rated no applause for
a vulgar series of lances with the cape and we
entered the third of the palings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alone in the centre of the ring the bull stood,
still fixed. Fuentes, tall, flat-backed, walking
toward him arrogantly, his arms spread out, the
two slim, red sticks, one in each hand, held by
the fingers, points straight forward. Fuentes
walked forward. Back of him and to one side
was a peon with a cape. The bull looked at him
and was no longer fixed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes watched Fuentes, now standing still.
Now he leaned back, calling to him. Fuentes
twitched the two banderillos and the light on
the steel points caught the bull’s eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tail went up and he charged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came straight, his eyes on the man.
Fuentes stood still, leaning back, the banderillos
pointing forward. As the bull lowered his head
to hook, Fuentes leaned backward, his arms
came together and rose, his two hands touching,
the banderillos two descending red lines,
and leaning forward drove the points into the
bull’s shoulder, leaning far in over the bull’s
horns and pivoting on the two upright sticks,
his legs tight together, his body curving to one
side to let the bull pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Olé!” from the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull was hooking wildly, jumping like a
trout, all four feet off the ground. The red
shaft of the banderillos tossed as he jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel standing at the barrera, noticed that
he hooked always to the right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him to drop the next pair on the right,”
he said to the kid who started to run out to
Fuentes with the new banderillos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A heavy hand fell on his shoulder. It was
Zurito.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you feel, kid?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel was watching the bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito leaned forward on the barrera, leaning
the weight of his body on his arms. Manuel
turned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going good,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel shook his head. He had nothing to
do now until the next third. The gypsy was
very good with the banderillos. The bull
would come to him in the next third in good
shape. He was a good bull. It had all been
easy up to now. The final stuff with the sword
was all he worried over. He did not really
worry. He did not even think about it. But
standing there he had a heavy sense of apprehension.
He looked out at the bull, planning
his faena, his work with the red cloth that was
to reduce the bull, to make him manageable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gypsy was walking out toward the bull
again, walking heel-and-toe, insultingly, like a
ball-room dancer, the red shafts of the banderillos
twitching with his walk. The bull watched
him, not fixed now, hunting him, but waiting to
get close enough so he could be sure of getting
him, getting the horns into him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Fuentes walked forward the bull charged.
Fuentes ran across the quarter of a circle as the
bull charged and, as he passed running backward,
stopped, swung forward, rose on his toes,
arms straight out, and sunk the banderillos
straight down into the tight of the big shoulder
muscles as the bull missed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd were wild about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That kid won’t stay in this night stuff long,”
Retana’s man said to Zurito.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s good,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuentes was standing with his back against
the barrera. Two of the cuadrilla were back
of him, with their capes ready to flop over the
fence to distract the bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull, with his tongue out, his barrel
heaving, was watching the gypsy. He thought
he had him now. Back against the red planks.
Only a short charge away. The bull watched
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gypsy bent back, drew back his arms,
the banderillos pointing at the bull. He called
to the bull, stamped one foot. The bull was
suspicious. He wanted the man. No more
barbs in the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuentes walked a little closer to the bull.
Bent back. Called again. Somebody in the
crowd shouted a warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s too damn close,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch him,” Retana’s man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning back, inciting the bull with the
banderillos, Fuentes jumped, both feet off the
ground. As he jumped the bull’s tail rose and
he charged. Fuentes came down on his toes,
arms straight out, whole body arching forward,
and drove the shafts straight down as he swung
his body clear of the right horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull crashed into the barrera where the
flopping capes had attracted his eye as he lost
the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gypsy came running along the barrera
toward Manuel, taking the applause of the
crowd. His vest was ripped where he had not
quite cleared the point of the horn. He was
happy about it, showing it to the spectators. He
made the tour of the ring. Zurito saw him go
by, smiling, pointing at his vest. He smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somebody else was planting the last pair of
banderillos. Nobody was paying any attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana’s man tucked a baton inside the red
cloth of a muleta, folded the cloth over it, and
handed it over the barrera to Manuel. He
reached in the leather sword-case, took out a
sword, and holding it by its leather scabbard,
reached it over the fence to Manuel. Manuel
pulled the blade out by the red hilt and the
scabbard fell limp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at Zurito. The big man saw he
was sweating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you get him, kid,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s in good shape,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just like you want him,” Retana’s man assured
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trumpeter, up under the roof, blew for
the final act, and Manuel walked across the
arena toward where, up in the dark boxes, the
president must be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the front row of seats the substitute bull-fight
critic of <span class='it'>El Heraldo</span> took a long drink of
the warm champagne. He had decided it was
not worth while to write a running story and
would write up the corrida back in the office.
What the hell was it anyway? Only a nocturnal.
If he missed anything he would get it out of the
morning papers. He took another drink of the
champagne. He had a date at Maxim’s at
twelve. Who were these bull-fighters anyway?
Kids and bums. A bunch of bums. He put his
pad of paper in his pocket and looked over toward
Manuel, standing very much alone in the
ring, gesturing with his hat in a salute toward
a box he could not see high up in the dark
plaza. Out in the ring the bull stood quiet,
looking at nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dedicate this bull to you, Mr. President,
and to the public of Madrid, the most intelligent
and generous of the world,” was what
Manuel was saying. It was a formula. He said
it all. It was a little long for nocturnal use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed at the dark, straightened, tossed
his hat over his shoulder, and, carrying the muleta
in his left hand and the sword in his right,
walked out toward the bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel walked toward the bull. The bull
looked at him; his eyes were quick. Manuel
noticed the way the banderillos hung down on
his left shoulder and the steady sheen of blood
from Zurito’s pic-ing. He noticed the way the
bull’s feet were. As he walked forward, holding
the muleta in his left hand and the sword
in his right, he watched the bull’s feet. The
bull could not charge without gathering his feet
together. Now he stood square on them, dully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel walked toward him, watching his
feet. This was all right. He could do this. He
must work to get the bull’s head down, so he
could go in past the horns and kill him. He
did not think about the sword, not about killing
the bull. He thought about one thing at a time.
The coming things oppressed him, though.
Walking forward, watching the bull’s feet, he
saw successively his eyes, his wet muzzle, and
the wide, forward-pointing spread of his horns.
The bull had light circles about his eyes. His
eyes watched Manuel. He felt he was going to
get this little one with the white face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing still now and spreading the red
cloth of the muleta with the sword, pricking the
point into the cloth so that the sword, now held
in his left hand, spread the red flannel like the
jib of a boat, Manuel noticed the points of the
bull’s horns. One of them was splintered from
banging against the barrera. The other was
sharp as a porcupine quill. Manuel noticed
while spreading the muleta that the white base
of the horn was stained red. While he noticed
these things he did not lose sight of the bull’s
feet. The bull watched Manuel steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’s on the defensive now, Manuel thought.
He’s reserving himself. I’ve got to bring him
out of that and get his head down. Always get
his head down. Zurito had his head down once,
but he’s come back. He’ll bleed when I start
him going and that will bring it down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holding the muleta, with the sword in his
left hand widening it in front of him, he called
to the bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull looked at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned back insultingly and shook the
wide-spread flannel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull saw the muleta. It was a bright
scarlet under the arc-light. The bull’s legs
tightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here he comes. Whoosh! Manuel turned
as the bull came and raised the muleta so that
it passed over the bull’s horns and swept down
his broad back from head to tail. The bull had
gone clean up in the air with the charge. Manuel
had not moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the pass the bull turned like
a cat coming around a corner and faced Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was on the offensive again. His heaviness
was gone. Manuel noted the fresh blood
shining down the black shoulder and dripping
down the bull’s leg. He drew the sword out of
the muleta and held it in his right hand. The
muleta held low down in his left hand, leaning
toward the left, he called to the bull. The
bull’s legs tightened, his eyes on the muleta.
Here he comes, Manuel thought. Yuh!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung with the charge, sweeping the muleta
ahead of the bull, his feet firm, the sword
following the curve, a point of light under the
arcs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull recharged as the pase natural finished
and Manuel raised the muleta for a pase
de pecho. Firmly planted, the bull came by his
chest under the raised muleta. Manuel leaned
his head back to avoid the clattering banderillo
shafts. The hot, black bull body touched his
chest as it passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too damn close, Manuel thought. Zurito,
leaning on the barrera, spoke rapidly to the
gypsy, who trotted out toward Manuel with a
cape. Zurito pulled his hat down low and
looked out across the arena at Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel was facing the bull again, the muleta
held low and to the left. The bull’s head was
down as he watched the muleta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it was Belmonte doing that stuff, they’d
go crazy,” Retana’s man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito said nothing. He was watching Manuel
out in the centre of the arena.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did the boss dig this fellow up?”
Retana’s man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of the hospital,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where he’s going damn quick,” Retana’s
man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito turned on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knock on that,” he said, pointing to the barrera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just kidding, man,” Retana’s man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knock on the wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana’s man leaned forward and knocked
three times on the barrera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch the faena,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out in the centre of the ring, under the
lights, Manuel was kneeling, facing the bull,
and as he raised the muleta in both hands the
bull charged, tail up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel swung his body clear and, as the bull
recharged, brought around the muleta in a half-circle
that pulled the bull to his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that one’s a great bull-fighter,” Retana’s
man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he’s not,” said Zurito.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel stood up and, the muleta in his left
hand, the sword in his right, acknowledged the
applause from the dark plaza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull had humped himself up from his
knees and stood waiting, his head hung low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito spoke to two of the other lads of the
cuadrilla and they ran out to stand back of
Manuel with their capes. There were four men
back of him now. Hernandez had followed
him since he first came out with the muleta.
Fuentes stood watching, his cape held against
his body, tall, in repose, watching lazy-eyed.
Now the two came up. Hernandez motioned
them to stand one at each side. Manuel stood
alone, facing the bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel waved back the men with the capes.
Stepping back cautiously, they saw his face was
white and sweating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Didn’t they know enough to keep back? Did
they want to catch the bull’s eye with the capes
after he was fixed and ready? He had enough
to worry about without that kind of thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull was standing, his four feet square,
looking at the muleta. Manuel furled the muleta
in his left hand. The bull’s eyes watched
it. His body was heavy on his feet. He carried
his head low, but not too low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel lifted the muleta at him. The bull
did not move. Only his eyes watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’s all lead, Manuel thought. He’s all
square. He’s framed right. He’ll take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought in bull-fight terms. Sometimes
he had a thought and the particular piece of
slang would not come into his mind and he
could not realize the thought. His instincts
and his knowledge worked automatically, and
his brain worked slowly and in words. He knew
all about bulls. He did not have to think about
them. He just did the right thing. His eyes
noted things and his body performed the necessary
measures without thought. If he thought
about it, he would be gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, facing the bull, he was conscious of
many things at the same time. There were the
horns, the one splintered, the other smoothly
sharp, the need to profile himself toward the
left horn, lance himself short and straight,
lower the muleta so the bull would follow it,
and, going in over the horns, put the sword all
the way into a little spot about as big as a five-peseta
piece straight in back of the neck, between
the sharp pitch of the bull’s shoulders.
He must do all this and must then come out
from between the horns. He was conscious he
must do all this, but his only thought was in
words: “Corto y derecho.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corto y derecho,” he thought, furling the
muleta. Short and straight. Corto y derecho,
he drew the sword out of the muleta, profiled
on the splintered left horn, dropped the muleta
across his body, so his right hand with the sword
on the level with his eye made the sign of the
cross, and, rising on his toes, sighted along the
dipping blade of the sword at the spot high up
between the bull’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corto y derecho he lanced himself on the
bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a shock, and he felt himself go
up in the air. He pushed on the sword as he
went up and over, and it flew out of his hand.
He hit the ground and the bull was on him.
Manuel, lying on the ground, kicked at the
bull’s muzzle with his slippered feet. Kicking,
kicking, the bull after him, missing him in his
excitement, bumping him with his head, driving
the horns into the sand. Kicking like a man
keeping a ball in the air, Manuel kept the bull
from getting a clean thrust at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel felt the wind on his back from the
capes flopping at the bull, and then the bull was
gone, gone over him in a rush. Dark, as his
belly went over. Not even stepped on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel stood up and picked up the muleta.
Fuentes handed him the sword. It was bent
where it had struck the shoulder-blade. Manuel
straightened it on his knee and ran toward
the bull, standing now beside one of the dead
horses. As he ran, his jacket flopped where it
had been ripped under his armpit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get him out of there,” Manuel shouted to
the gypsy. The bull had smelled the blood
of the dead horse and ripped into the canvas-cover
with his horns. He charged Fuentes’s
cape, with the canvas hanging from his splintered
horn, and the crowd laughed. Out in the
ring, he tossed his head to rid himself of the
canvas. Hernandez, running up from behind
him, grabbed the end of the canvas and neatly
lifted it off the horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull followed it in a half-charge and
stopped still. He was on the defensive again.
Manuel was walking toward him with the sword
and muleta. Manuel swung the muleta before
him. The bull would not charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel profiled toward the bull, sighting
along the dipping blade of the sword. The
bull was motionless, seemingly dead on his feet,
incapable of another charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel rose to his toes, sighting along the
steel, and charged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again there was the shock and he felt himself
being borne back in a rush, to strike hard on the
sand. There was no chance of kicking this time.
The bull was on top of him. Manuel lay as
though dead, his head on his arms, and the bull
bumped him. Bumped his back, bumped his
face in the sand. He felt the horn go into the
sand between his folded arms. The bull hit
him in the small of the back. His face drove
into the sand. The horn drove through one of
his sleeves and the bull ripped it off. Manuel
was tossed clear and the bull followed the capes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel got up, found the sword and muleta,
tried the point of the sword with his thumb, and
then ran toward the barrera for a new sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana’s man handed him the sword over
the edge of the barrera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wipe off your face,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel, running again toward the bull,
wiped his bloody face with his handkerchief.
He had not seen Zurito. Where was Zurito?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cuadrilla had stepped away from the
bull and waited with their capes. The bull
stood, heavy and dull again after the action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel walked toward him with the muleta.
He stopped and shook it. The bull did not respond.
He passed it right and left, left and
right before the bull’s muzzle. The bull’s eyes
watched it and turned with the swing, but he
would not charge. He was waiting for Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel was worried. There was nothing to
do but go in. Corto y derecho. He profiled
close to the bull, crossed the muleta in front
of his body and charged. As he pushed in the
sword, he jerked his body to the left to clear
the horn. The bull passed him and the sword
shot up in the air, twinkling under the arc-lights,
to fall red-hilted on the sand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel ran over and picked it up. It was
bent and he straightened it over his knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he came running toward the bull, fixed
again now, he passed Hernandez standing with
his cape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all bone,” the boy said encouragingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel nodded, wiping his face. He put the
bloody handkerchief in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the bull. He was close to the barrera
now. Damn him. Maybe he was all bone.
Maybe there was not any place for the sword to
go in. The hell there wasn’t! He’d show
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried a pass with the muleta and the bull
did not move. Manuel chopped the muleta back
and forth in front of the bull. Nothing doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He furled the muleta, drew the sword out,
profiled and drove in on the bull. He felt the
sword buckle as he shoved it in, leaning his
weight on it, and then it shot high in the air,
end-over-ending into the crowd. Manuel had
jerked clear as the sword jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first cushions thrown down out of the
dark missed him. Then one hit him in the face,
his bloody face looking toward the crowd. They
were coming down fast. Spotting the sand.
Somebody threw an empty champagne-bottle
from close range. It hit Manuel on the foot.
He stood there watching the dark, where the
things were coming from. Then something
whished through the air and struck by him.
Manuel leaned over and picked it up. It was
his sword. He straightened it over his knee and
gestured with it to the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said. “Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, the dirty bastards! Dirty bastards! Oh,
the lousy, dirty bastards! He kicked into a
cushion as he ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the bull. The same as ever. All
right, you dirty, lousy bastard!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel passed the muleta in front of the
bull’s black muzzle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You won’t! All right. He stepped close
and jammed the sharp peak of the muleta into
the bull’s damp muzzle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull was on him as he jumped back and
as he tripped on a cushion he felt the horn go
into him, into his side. He grabbed the horn
with his two hands and rode backward, holding
tight onto the place. The bull tossed him and
he was clear. He lay still. It was all right.
The bull was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up coughing and feeling broken and
gone. The dirty bastards!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the sword,” he shouted. “Give
me the stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuentes came up with the muleta and the
sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hernandez put his arm around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on to the infirmary, man,” he said.
“Don’t be a damn fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get away from me,” Manuel said. “Get to
hell away from me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He twisted free. Hernandez shrugged his
shoulders. Manuel ran toward the bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the bull standing, heavy, firmly
planted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All right, you bastard! Manuel drew the
sword out of the muleta, sighted with the same
movement, and flung himself onto the bull.
He felt the sword go in all the way. Right up
to the guard. Four fingers and his thumb into
the bull. The blood was hot on his knuckles,
and he was on top of the bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull lurched with him as he lay on, and
seemed to sink; then he was standing clear. He
looked at the bull going down slowly over on
his side, then suddenly four feet in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he gestured at the crowd, his hand
warm from the bull blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All right, you bastards! He wanted to say
something, but he started to cough. It was hot
and choking. He looked down for the muleta.
He must go over and salute the president.
President hell! He was sitting down looking at
something. It was the bull. His four feet up.
Thick tongue out. Things crawling around on
his belly and under his legs. Crawling where
the hair was thin. Dead bull. To hell with
the bull! To hell with them all! He started to
get to his feet and commenced to cough. He
sat down again, coughing. Somebody came and
pushed him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They carried him across the ring to the infirmary,
running with him across the sand,
standing blocked at the gate as the mules came
in, then around under the dark passageway, men
grunting as they took him up the stairway, and
then laid him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor and two men in white were waiting
for him. They laid him out on the table.
They were cutting away his shirt. Manuel felt
tired. His whole chest felt scalding inside.
He started to cough and they held something
to his mouth. Everybody was very busy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an electric light in his eyes. He
shut his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard some one coming very heavily up
the stairs. Then he did not hear it. Then he
heard a noise far off. That was the crowd.
Well, somebody would have to kill his other
bull. They had cut away all his shirt. The
doctor smiled at him. There was Retana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Retana!” Manuel said. He could
not hear his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana smiled at him and said something.
Manuel could not hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito stood beside the table, bending over
where the doctor was working. He was in his
picador clothes, without his hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito said something to him. Manuel could
not hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito was speaking to Retana. One of the
men in white smiled and handed Retana a pair
of scissors. Retana gave them to Zurito.
Zurito said something to Manuel. He could
not hear it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To hell with this operating-table! He’d
been on plenty of operating-tables before. He
was not going to die. There would be a priest
if he was going to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zurito was saying something to him. Holding
up the scissors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was it. They were going to cut off his
coleta. They were going to cut off his pigtail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel sat up on the operating-table. The
doctor stepped back, angry. Some one grabbed
him and held him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t do a thing like that, Manos,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard suddenly, clearly, Zurito’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” Zurito said. “I won’t do
it. I was joking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going good,” Manuel said. “I didn’t
have any luck. That was all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel lay back. They had put something
over his face. It was all familiar. He inhaled
deeply. He felt very tired. He was very,
very tired. They took the thing away from his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going good,” Manuel said weakly.
“I was going great.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana looked at Zurito and started for the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stay here with him,” Zurito said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retana shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel opened his eyes and looked at Zurito.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t I going good, Manos?” he asked,
for confirmation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said Zurito. “You were going great.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s assistant put the cone over Manuel’s
face and he inhaled deeply. Zurito stood
awkwardly, watching.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>IN ANOTHER COUNTRY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> the fall the war was always there, but we
did not go to it any more. It was cold in the
fall in Milan and the dark came very early.
Then the electric lights came on, and it was
pleasant along the streets looking in the windows.
There was much game hanging outside
the shops, and the snow powdered in the fur
of the foxes and the wind blew their tails. The
deer hung stiff and heavy and empty, and small
birds blew in the wind and the wind turned their
feathers. It was a cold fall and the wind came
down from the mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were all at the hospital every afternoon,
and there were different ways of walking across
the town through the dusk to the hospital. Two
of the ways were alongside canals, but they were
long. Always, though, you crossed a bridge
across a canal to enter the hospital. There was a
choice of three bridges. On one of them a
woman sold roasted chestnuts. It was warm,
standing in front of her charcoal fire, and the
chestnuts were warm afterward in your pocket.
The hospital was very old and very beautiful,
and you entered through a gate and walked
across a courtyard and out a gate on the other
side. There were usually funerals starting from
the courtyard. Beyond the old hospital were
the new brick pavilions, and there we met every
afternoon and were all very polite and interested
in what was the matter, and sat in the machines
that were to make so much difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor came up to the machine where
I was sitting and said: “What did you like best
to do before the war? Did you practise a
sport?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “Yes, football.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” he said. “You will be able to play
football again better than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My knee did not bend and the leg dropped
straight from the knee to the ankle without a
calf, and the machine was to bend the knee and
make it move as in riding a tricycle. But it did
not bend yet, and instead the machine lurched
when it came to the bending part. The doctor
said: “That will all pass. You are a fortunate
young man. You will play football again like
a champion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the next machine was a major who had a
little hand like a baby’s. He winked at me
when the doctor examined his hand, which was
between two leather straps that bounced up and
down and flapped the stiff fingers, and said:
“And will I too play football, captain-doctor?”
He had been a very great fencer, and before the
war the greatest fencer in Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor went to his office in a back room
and brought a photograph which showed a
hand that had been withered almost as small
as the major’s, before it had taken a machine
course, and after was a little larger. The major
held the photograph with his good hand and
looked at it very carefully. “A wound?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An industrial accident,” the doctor said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very interesting, very interesting,” the major
said, and handed it back to the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have confidence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the major.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were three boys who came each day
who were about the same age I was. They were
all three from Milan, and one of them was to
be a lawyer, and one was to be a painter, and
one had intended to be a soldier, and after we
were finished with the machines, sometimes we
walked back together to the Café Cova, which
was next door to the Scala. We walked the
short way through the communist quarter because
we were four together. The people hated
us because we were officers, and from a wine-shop
some one would call out, “A basso gli ufficiali!”
as we passed. Another boy who walked
with us sometimes and made us five wore a
black silk handkerchief across his face because
he had no nose then and his face was to be rebuilt.
He had gone out to the front from the
military academy and been wounded within an
hour after he had gone into the front line for
the first time. They rebuilt his face, but he
came from a very old family and they could
never get the nose exactly right. He went to
South America and worked in a bank. But this
was a long time ago, and then we did not any
of us know how it was going to be afterward.
We only knew then that there was always the
war, but that we were not going to it any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all had the same medals, except the boy
with the black silk bandage across his face, and
he had not been at the front long enough to get
any medals. The tall boy with a very pale face
who was to be a lawyer had been a lieutenant
of Arditi and had three medals of the sort we
each had only one of. He had lived a very long
time with death and was a little detached. We
were all a little detached, and there was nothing
that held us together except that we met
every afternoon at the hospital. Although, as
we walked to the Cova through the tough part
of town, walking in the dark, with light and
singing coming out of the wine-shops, and sometimes
having to walk into the street when the
men and women would crowd together on the
sidewalk so that we would have had to jostle
them to get by, we felt held together by there
being something that had happened that they,
the people who disliked us, did not understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ourselves all understood the Cova, where
it was rich and warm and not too brightly
lighted, and noisy and smoky at certain hours,
and there were always girls at the tables and
the illustrated papers on a rack on the wall.
The girls at the Cova were very patriotic, and I
found that the most patriotic people in Italy
were the café girls—and I believe they are still
patriotic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys at first were very polite about my
medals and asked me what I had done to get
them. I showed them the papers, which were
written in very beautiful language and full of
<span class='it'>fratellanza</span> and <span class='it'>abnegazione</span>, but which really
said, with the adjectives removed, that I had
been given the medals because I was an American.
After that their manner changed a little
toward me, although I was their friend against
outsiders. I was a friend, but I was never really
one of them after they had read the citations,
because it had been different with them and they
had done very different things to get their
medals. I had been wounded, it was true; but
we all knew that being wounded, after all, was
really an accident. I was never ashamed of the
ribbons, though, and sometimes, after the cocktail
hour, I would imagine myself having done
all the things they had done to get their medals;
but walking home at night through the empty
streets with the cold wind and all the shops
closed, trying to keep near the street lights, I
knew that I would never have done such things,
and I was very much afraid to die, and often
lay in bed at night by myself, afraid to die and
wondering how I would be when I went back to
the front again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three with the medals were like hunting-hawks;
and I was not a hawk, although I might
seem a hawk to those who had never hunted;
they, the three, knew better and so we drifted
apart. But I stayed good friends with the boy
who had been wounded his first day at the front,
because he would never know now how he
would have turned out; so he could never be
accepted either, and I liked him because I
thought perhaps he would not have turned out
to be a hawk either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The major, who had been the great fencer,
did not believe in bravery, and spent much time
while we sat in the machines correcting my
grammar. He had complimented me on how
I spoke Italian, and we talked together very
easily. One day I had said that Italian seemed
such an easy language to me that I could not
take a great interest in it; everything was so
easy to say. “Ah, yes,” the major said. “Why,
then, do you not take up the use of grammar?”
So we took up the use of grammar, and soon
Italian was such a difficult language that I was
afraid to talk to him until I had the grammar
straight in my mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The major came very regularly to the hospital.
I do not think he ever missed a day, although
I am sure he did not believe in the
machines. There was a time when none of us
believed in the machines, and one day the major
said it was all nonsense. The machines were
new then and it was we who were to prove them.
It was an idiotic idea, he said, “a theory, like
another.” I had not learned my grammar, and
he said I was a stupid impossible disgrace, and
he was a fool to have bothered with me. He
was a small man and he sat straight up in his
chair with his right hand thrust into the machine
and looked straight ahead at the wall
while the straps thumped up and down with his
fingers in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do when the war is over if
it is over?” he asked me. “Speak grammatically!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go to the States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I hope to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more of a fool you are,” he said. He
seemed very angry. “A man must not marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Signor Maggiore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t call me ‘Signor Maggiore.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why must not a man marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He cannot marry. He cannot marry,” he
said angrily. “If he is to lose everything, he
should not place himself in a position to lose
that. He should not place himself in a position
to lose. He should find things he cannot lose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke very angrily and bitterly, and
looked straight ahead while he talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why should he necessarily lose it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll lose it,” the major said. He was
looking at the wall. Then he looked down at
the machine and jerked his little hand out from
between the straps and slapped it hard against
his thigh. “He’ll lose it,” he almost shouted.
“Don’t argue with me!” Then he called to the
attendant who ran the machines. “Come and
turn this damned thing off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went back into the other room for the
light treatment and the massage. Then I heard
him ask the doctor if he might use his telephone
and he shut the door. When he came
back into the room, I was sitting in another machine.
He was wearing his cape and had his
cap on, and he came directly toward my machine
and put his arm on my shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so sorry,” he said, and patted me on
the shoulder with his good hand. “I would not
be rude. My wife has just died. You must
forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—” I said, feeling sick for him. “I am
<span class='it'>so</span> sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood there biting his lower lip. “It is
very difficult,” he said. “I cannot resign myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked straight past me and out through
the window. Then he began to cry. “I am utterly
unable to resign myself,” he said and
choked. And then crying, his head up looking
at nothing, carrying himself straight and soldierly,
with tears on both his cheeks and biting
his lips, he walked past the machines and out
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor told me that the major’s wife,
who was very young and whom he had not married
until he was definitely invalided out of the
war, had died of pneumonia. She had been
sick only a few days. No one expected her to
die. The major did not come to the hospital
for three days. Then he came at the usual hour,
wearing a black band on the sleeve of his uniform.
When he came back, there were large
framed photographs around the wall, of all sorts
of wounds before and after they had been cured
by the machines. In front of the machine the
major used were three photographs of hands
like his that were completely restored. I do not
know where the doctor got them. I always understood
we were the first to use the machines.
The photographs did not make much difference
to the major because he only looked out of the
window.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>HILLS LIKE WHITE ELEPHANTS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> hills across the valley of the Ebro were
long and white. On this side there was no
shade and no trees and the station was between
two lines of rails in the sun. Close against the
side of the station there was the warm shadow
of the building and a curtain, made of strings of
bamboo beads, hung across the open door into
the bar, to keep out flies. The American and
the girl with him sat at a table in the shade,
outside the building. It was very hot and the
express from Barcelona would come in forty
minutes. It stopped at this junction for two
minutes and went on to Madrid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should we drink?” the girl asked.
She had taken off her hat and put it on the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty hot,” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s drink beer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dos cervezas,” the man said into the curtain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Big ones?” a woman asked from the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Two big ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman brought two glasses of beer and
two felt pads. She put the felt pads and the
beer glasses on the table and looked at the man
and the girl. The girl was looking off at the
line of hills. They were white in the sun and
the country was brown and dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They look like white elephants,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never seen one,” the man drank his
beer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you wouldn’t have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have,” the man said. “Just because
you say I wouldn’t have doesn’t prove
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at the bead curtain.
“They’ve painted something on it,” she said.
“What does it say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anis del Toro. It’s a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could we try it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man called “Listen” through the curtain.
The woman came out from the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four reales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want two Anis del Toro.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want it with water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” the girl said. “Is it good
with water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want them with water?” asked the
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, with water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It tastes like licorice,” the girl said and put
the glass down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way with everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the girl. “Everything tastes of
licorice. Especially all the things you’ve waited
so long for, like absinthe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, cut it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You started it,” the girl said. “I was being
amused. I was having a fine time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s try and have a fine time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I was trying. I said the mountains
looked like white elephants. Wasn’t that
bright?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was bright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to try this new drink. That’s all
we do, isn’t it—look at things and try new
drinks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked across at the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re lovely hills,” she said. “They
don’t really look like white elephants. I just
meant the coloring of their skin through the
trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should we have another drink?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warm wind blew the bead curtain against
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beer’s nice and cool,” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s lovely,” the girl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s really an awfully simple operation, Jig,”
the man said. “It’s not really an operation at
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at the ground the table legs
rested on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you wouldn’t mind it, Jig. It’s
really not anything. It’s just to let the air in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl did not say anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go with you and I’ll stay with you all
the time. They just let the air in and then it’s
all perfectly natural.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what will we do afterward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be fine afterward. Just like we were
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the only thing that bothers us. It’s
the only thing that’s made us unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at the bead curtain, put her
hand out and took hold of two of the strings of
beads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think then we’ll be all right and
be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know we will. You don’t have to be
afraid. I’ve known lots of people that have
done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So have I,” said the girl. “And afterward
they were all so happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” the man said, “if you don’t want
to you don’t have to. I wouldn’t have you do
it if you didn’t want to. But I know it’s perfectly
simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you really want to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s the best thing to do. But I don’t
want you to do it if you don’t really want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I do it you’ll be happy and things
will be like they were and you’ll love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you now. You know I love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. But if I do it, then it will be nice
again if I say things are like white elephants,
and you’ll like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll love it. I love it now but I just can’t
think about it. You know how I get when I
worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I do it you won’t ever worry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t worry about that because it’s perfectly
simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll do it. Because I don’t care about
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care about me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I care about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. But I don’t care about me. And
I’ll do it and then everything will be fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to do it if you feel that
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stood up and walked to the end of
the station. Across, on the other side, were
fields of grain and trees along the banks of the
Ebro. Far away, beyond the river, were mountains.
The shadow of a cloud moved across the
field of grain and she saw the river through the
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we could have all this,” she said. “And
we could have everything and every day we
make it more impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said we could have everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can have everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can have the whole world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can go everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we can’t. It isn’t ours any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t. And once they take it away,
you never get it back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they haven’t taken it away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll wait and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on back in the shade,” he said. “You
mustn’t feel that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t feel any way,” the girl said. “I
just know things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want you to do anything that you
don’t want to do——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor that isn’t good for me,” she said. “I
know. Could we have another beer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. But you’ve got to realize——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I realize,” the girl said. “Can’t we maybe
stop talking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down at the table and the girl
looked across at the hills on the dry side of the
valley and the man looked at her and at the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to realize,” he said, “that I don’t
want you to do it if you don’t want to. I’m
perfectly willing to go through with it if it
means anything to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t it mean anything to you? We could
get along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it does. But I don’t want anybody
but you. I don’t want any one else. And
I know it’s perfectly simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you know it’s perfectly simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right for you to say that, but I do
know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you do something for me now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d do anything for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you please please please please
please please please stop talking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not say anything but looked at the
bags against the wall of the station. There
were labels on them from all the hotels where
they had spent nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t want you to,” he said, “I don’t
care anything about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll scream,” the girl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman came out through the curtains
with two glasses of beer and put them down on
the damp felt pads. “The train comes in five
minutes,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did she say?” asked the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the train is coming in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl smiled brightly at the woman, to
thank her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d better take the bags over to the other
side of the station,” the man said. She smiled
at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Then come back and we’ll finish
the beer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked up the two heavy bags and carried
them around the station to the other tracks. He
looked up the tracks but could not see the train.
Coming back, he walked through the barroom,
where people waiting for the train were drinking.
He drank an Anis at the bar and looked
at the people. They were all waiting reasonably
for the train. He went out through the
bead curtain. She was sitting at the table and
smiled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you feel better?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel fine,” she said. “There’s nothing
wrong with me. I feel fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> door of Henry’s lunch-room opened
and two men came in. They sat down at the
counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s yours?” George asked them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” one of the men said. “What
do you want to eat, Al?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Al. “I don’t know what
I want to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside it was getting dark. The street-light
came on outside the window. The two men at
the counter read the menu. From the other
end of the counter Nick Adams watched them.
He had been talking to George when they
came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have a roast pork tenderloin with apple
sauce and mashed potatoes,” the first man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t ready yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell do you put it on the card
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the dinner,” George explained.
“You can get that at six o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George looked at the clock on the wall behind
the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s five o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The clock says twenty minutes past five,”
the second man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s twenty minutes fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, to hell with the clock,” the first man
said. “What have you got to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can give you any kind of sandwiches,”
George said. “You can have ham and eggs,
bacon and eggs, liver and bacon, or a steak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me chicken croquettes with green peas
and cream sauce and mashed potatoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything we want’s the dinner, eh?
That’s the way you work it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can give you ham and eggs, bacon and
eggs, liver——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take ham and eggs,” the man called Al
said. He wore a derby hat and a black overcoat
buttoned across the chest. His face was
small and white and he had tight lips. He
wore a silk muffler and gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me bacon and eggs,” said the other
man. He was about the same size as Al. Their
faces were different, but they were dressed like
twins. Both wore overcoats too tight for them.
They sat leaning forward, their elbows on the
counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got anything to drink?” Al asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silver beer, bevo, ginger-ale,” George said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean you got anything to <span class='it'>drink</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just those I said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a hot town,” said the other. “What
do they call it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Summit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever hear of it?” Al asked his friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do here nights?” Al asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They eat the dinner,” his friend said.
“They all come here and eat the big dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” George said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you think that’s right?” Al asked George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a pretty bright boy, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re not,” said the other little man.
“Is he, Al?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s dumb,” said Al. He turned to Nick.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another bright boy,” Al said. “Ain’t he a
bright boy, Max?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The town’s full of bright boys,” Max said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George put the two platters, one of ham and
eggs, the other of bacon and eggs, on the counter.
He set down two side-dishes of fried potatoes
and closed the wicket into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is yours?” he asked Al.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ham and eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a bright boy,” Max said. He leaned
forward and took the ham and eggs. Both men
ate with their gloves on. George watched them
eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are <span class='it'>you</span> looking at?” Max looked at
George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hell you were. You were looking at
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe the boy meant it for a joke, Max,”
Al said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> don’t have to laugh,” Max said to him.
“<span class='it'>You</span> don’t have to laugh at all, see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he thinks it’s all right.” Max turned to
Al. “He thinks it’s all right. That’s a good
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’s a thinker,” Al said. They went on
eating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the bright boy’s name down the
counter?” Al asked Max.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, bright boy,” Max said to Nick. “You
go around on the other side of the counter with
your boy friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the idea?” Nick asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t any idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You better go around, bright boy,” Al said.
Nick went around behind the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the idea?” George asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of your damn business,” Al said.
“Who’s out in the kitchen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nigger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean the nigger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nigger that cooks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him to come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him to come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you think you are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know damn well where we are,” the
man called Max said. “Do we look silly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk silly,” Al said to him. “What the
hell do you argue with this kid for? Listen,”
he said to George, “tell the nigger to come out
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. Use your head, bright boy.
What would we do to a nigger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George opened the slit that opened back into
the kitchen. “Sam,” he called. “Come in here
a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door to the kitchen opened and the nigger
came in. “What was it?” he asked. The
two men at the counter took a look at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, nigger. You stand right there,”
Al said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam, the nigger, standing in his apron, looked
at the two men sitting at the counter. “Yes,
sir,” he said. Al got down from his stool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going back to the kitchen with the nigger
and bright boy,” he said. “Go on back to
the kitchen, nigger. You go with him, bright
boy.” The little man walked after Nick and
Sam, the cook, back into the kitchen. The door
shut after them. The man called Max sat at
the counter opposite George. He didn’t look at
George but looked in the mirror that ran along
back of the counter. Henry’s had been made
over from a saloon into a lunch-counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, bright boy,” Max said, looking into
the mirror, “why don’t you say something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s it all about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Al,” Max called, “bright boy wants
to know what it’s all about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you tell him?” Al’s voice came
from the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think it’s all about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Max looked into the mirror all the time he
was talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Al, bright boy says he wouldn’t say
what he thinks it’s all about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can hear you, all right,” Al said from the
kitchen. He had propped open the slit that
dishes passed through into the kitchen with a
catsup bottle. “Listen, bright boy,” he said
from the kitchen to George. “Stand a little further
along the bar. You move a little to the left,
Max.” He was like a photographer arranging
for a group picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talk to me, bright boy,” Max said. “What
do you think’s going to happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George did not say anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you,” Max said. “We’re going to
kill a Swede. Do you know a big Swede named
Ole Andreson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He comes here to eat every night, don’t
he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes he comes here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He comes here at six o’clock, don’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know all that, bright boy,” Max said.
“Talk about something else. Ever go to the
movies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once in a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to go to the movies more. The
movies are fine for a bright boy like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to kill Ole Andreson
for? What did he ever do to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never had a chance to do anything to us.
He never even seen us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he’s only going to see us once,” Al said
from the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to kill him for, then?”
George asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re killing him for a friend. Just to
oblige a friend, bright boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up,” said Al from the kitchen. “You
talk too goddam much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I got to keep bright boy amused.
Don’t I, bright boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk too damn much,” Al said. “The
nigger and my bright boy are amused by themselves.
I got them tied up like a couple of girl
friends in the convent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you were in a convent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were in a kosher convent. That’s
where you were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George looked up at the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If anybody comes in you tell them the cook
is off, and if they keep after it, you tell them
you’ll go back and cook yourself. Do you get
that, bright boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” George said. “What you going
to do with us afterward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll depend,” Max said. “That’s one
of those things you never know at the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>George looked up at the clock. It was a
quarter past six. The door from the street
opened. A street-car motorman came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, George,” he said. “Can I get supper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sam’s gone out,” George said. “He’ll be
back in about half an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d better go up the street,” the motorman
said. George looked at the clock. It was twenty
minutes past six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was nice, bright boy,” Max said.
“You’re a regular little gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knew I’d blow his head off,” Al said
from the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Max. “It ain’t that. Bright
boy is nice. He’s a nice boy. I like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At six-fifty-five George said: “He’s not coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two other people had been in the lunch-room.
Once George had gone out to the kitchen
and made a ham-and-egg sandwich “to
go” that a man wanted to take with him. Inside
the kitchen he saw Al, his derby hat tipped back,
sitting on a stool beside the wicket with the
muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun resting on the
ledge. Nick and the cook were back to back in
the corner, a towel tied in each of their mouths.
George had cooked the sandwich, wrapped it
up in oiled paper, put it in a bag, brought it in,
and the man had paid for it and gone out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bright boy can do everything,” Max said.
“He can cook and everything. You’d make
some girl a nice wife, bright boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” George said. “Your friend, Ole
Andreson, isn’t going to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll give him ten minutes,” Max said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Max watched the mirror and the clock. The
hands of the clock marked seven o’clock, and
then five minutes past seven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Al,” said Max. “We better go.
He’s not coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better give him five minutes,” Al said from
the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the five minutes a man came in, and
George explained that the cook was sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the hell don’t you get another cook?”
the man asked. “Aren’t you running a lunch-counter?”
He went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Al,” Max said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the two bright boys and the
nigger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. We’re through with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like it,” said Al. “It’s sloppy. You
talk too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what the hell,” said Max. “We got
to keep amused, haven’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk too much, all the same,” Al said.
He came out from the kitchen. The cut-off
barrels of the shotgun made a slight bulge
under the waist of his too tight-fitting overcoat.
He straightened his coat with his gloved
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long, bright boy,” he said to George.
“You got a lot of luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the truth,” Max said. “You ought
to play the races, bright boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two of them went out the door. George
watched them, through the window, pass under
the arc-light and cross the street. In their
tight overcoats and derby hats they looked like
a vaudeville team. George went back through
the swinging-door into the kitchen and untied
Nick and the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any more of that,” said Sam,
the cook. “I don’t want any more of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick stood up. He had never had a towel
in his mouth before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” he said. “What the hell?” He was
trying to swagger it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were going to kill Ole Andreson,”
George said. “They were going to shoot him
when he came in to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ole Andreson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cook felt the corners of his mouth with
his thumbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all gone?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah,” said George. “They’re gone now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like it,” said the cook. “I don’t
like any of it at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” George said to Nick. “You better
go see Ole Andreson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You better not have anything to do with it
at all,” Sam, the cook, said. “You better stay
way out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t go if you don’t want to,” George
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mixing up in this ain’t going to get you
anywhere,” the cook said. “You stay out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go see him,” Nick said to George.
“Where does he live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cook turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little boys always know what they want
to do,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lives up at Hirsch’s rooming-house,”
George said to Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go up there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside the arc-light shone through the bare
branches of a tree. Nick walked up the street
beside the car-tracks and turned at the next arc-light
down a side-street. Three houses up the
street was Hirsch’s rooming-house. Nick
walked up the two steps and pushed the bell.
A woman came to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Ole Andreson here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to see him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if he’s in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick followed the woman up a flight of
stairs and back to the end of a corridor. She
knocked on the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s somebody to see you, Mr. Andreson,”
the woman said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Nick Adams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick opened the door and went into the
room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with
all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight
prizefighter and he was too long for the bed.
He lay with his head on two pillows. He did
not look at Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was up at Henry’s,” Nick said, “and two
fellows came in and tied up me and the cook,
and they said they were going to kill you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson
said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They put us out in the kitchen,” Nick went
on. “They were going to shoot you when you
came in to supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not
say anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“George thought I better come and tell you
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t anything I can do about it,” Ole
Andreson said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what they were like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to know what they were like,”
Ole Andreson said. He looked at the wall.
“Thanks for coming to tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick looked at the big man lying on the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you want me to go and see the police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Ole Andreson said. “That wouldn’t
do any good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t there something I could do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. There ain’t anything to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it was just a bluff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It ain’t just a bluff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ole Andreson rolled over toward the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only thing is,” he said, talking toward
the wall, “I just can’t make up my mind to go
out. I been in here all day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you get out of town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Ole Andreson said. “I’m through
with all that running around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t anything to do now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you fix it up some way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I got in wrong.” He talked in the
same flat voice. “There ain’t anything to do.
After a while I’ll make up my mind to go out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I better go back and see George,” Nick
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long,” said Ole Andreson. He did not
look toward Nick. “Thanks for coming
around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick went out. As he shut the door he saw
Ole Andreson with all his clothes on, lying on
the bed looking at the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been in his room all day,” the landlady
said downstairs. “I guess he don’t feel
well. I said to him: ‘Mr. Andreson, you
ought to go out and take a walk on a nice fall
day like this,’ but he didn’t feel like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t want to go out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry he don’t feel well,” the woman
said. “He’s an awfully nice man. He was in
the ring, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d never know it except from the way
his face is,” the woman said. They stood talking
just inside the street door. “He’s just as
gentle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good-night, Mrs. Hirsch,” Nick said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not Mrs. Hirsch,” the woman said.
“She owns the place. I just look after it for
her. I’m Mrs. Bell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good-night, Mrs. Bell,” Nick said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night,” the woman said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick walked up the dark street to the corner
under the arc-light, and then along the car-tracks
to Henry’s eating-house. George was
inside, back of the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see Ole?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Nick. “He’s in his room and he
won’t go out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cook opened the door from the kitchen
when he heard Nick’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t even listen to it,” he said and shut
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you tell him about it?” George asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. I told him but he knows what it’s
all about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s he going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll kill him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess they will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must have got mixed up in something
in Chicago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess so,” said Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a hell of a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an awful thing,” Nick said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not say anything. George reached
down for a towel and wiped the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what he did?” Nick said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Double-crossed somebody. That’s what
they kill them for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to get out of this town,” Nick
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said George. “That’s a good thing
to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t stand to think about him waiting in
the room and knowing he’s going to get it.
It’s too damned awful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said George, “you better not think
about it.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHE TI DICE LA PATRIA?</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> road of the pass was hard and smooth
and not yet dusty in the early morning. Below
were the hills with oak and chestnut trees,
and far away below was the sea. On the other
side were snowy mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We came down from the pass through
wooded country. There were bags of charcoal
piled beside the road, and through the trees
we saw charcoal-burners’ huts. It was Sunday
and the road, rising and falling, but always
dropping away from the altitude of the pass,
went through the scrub woods and through villages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside the villages there were fields with
vines. The fields were brown and the vines
coarse and thick. The houses were white, and
in the streets the men, in their Sunday clothes,
were playing bowls. Against the walls of some
of the houses there were pear trees, their
branches candelabraed against the white walls.
The pear trees had been sprayed, and the walls
of the houses were stained a metallic blue-green
by the spray vapor. There were small
clearings around the villages where the vines
grew, and then the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a village, twenty kilometres above Spezia,
there was a crowd in the square, and a young
man carrying a suitcase came up to the car and
asked us to take him in to Spezia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are only two places, and they are occupied,”
I said. We had an old Ford coupé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will ride on the outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes nothing. I must go to Spezia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should we take him?” I asked Guy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He seems to be going anyway,” Guy said.
The young man handed in a parcel through the
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look after this,” he said. Two men tied
his suitcase on the back of the car, above our
suitcases. He shook hands with every one, explained
that to a Fascist and a man as used to
travelling as himself there was no discomfort,
and climbed up on the running-board on the
left-hand side of the car, holding on inside, his
right arm through the open window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can start,” he said. The crowd waved.
He waved with his free hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he say?” Guy asked me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we could start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he nice?” Guy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road followed a river. Across the river
were mountains. The sun was taking the frost
out of the grass. It was bright and cold and
the air came cold through the open wind-shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you think he likes it out there?”
Guy was looking up the road. His view out of
his side of the car was blocked by our guest.
The young man projected from the side of the
car like the figurehead of a ship. He had
turned his coat collar up and pulled his hat
down and his nose looked cold in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’ll get enough of it,” Guy said.
“That’s the side our bum tire’s on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he’d leave us if we blew out,” I said.
“He wouldn’t get his travelling-clothes dirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t mind him,” Guy said—“except
the way he leans out on the turns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woods were gone; the road had left the
river to climb; the radiator was boiling; the
young man looked annoyedly and suspiciously
at the steam and rusty water; the engine was
grinding, with both Guy’s feet on the first-speed
pedal, up and up, back and forth and
up, and, finally, out level. The grinding
stopped, and in the new quiet there was a great
churning bubbling in the radiator. We were
at the top of the last range above Spezia and
the sea. The road descended with short, barely
rounded turns. Our guest hung out on the
turns and nearly pulled the top-heavy car over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t tell him not to,” I said to Guy.
“It’s his sense of self-preservation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The great Italian sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The greatest Italian sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We came down around curves, through deep
dust, the dust powdering the olive trees.
Spezia spread below along the sea. The road
flattened outside the town. Our guest put his
head in the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop it,” I said to Guy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We slowed up, at the side of the road. The
young man got down, went to the back of the
car and untied the suitcase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stop here, so you won’t get into trouble
carrying passengers,” he said. “My package.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I handed him the package. He reached in
his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do I owe you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then thanks,” the young man said, not
“thank you,” or “thank you very much,” or
“thank you a thousand times,” all of which you
formerly said in Italy to a man when he handed
you a time-table or explained about a direction.
The young man uttered the lowest form of the
word “thanks” and looked after us suspiciously
as Guy started the car. I waved my hand at
him. He was too dignified to reply. We went
on into Spezia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a young man that will go a long way
in Italy,” I said to Guy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Guy, “he went twenty kilometres
with us.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>A MEAL IN SPEZIA</p>

<p class='pindent'>We came into Spezia looking for a place to
eat. The street was wide and the houses high
and yellow. We followed the tram-track into
the centre of town. On the walls of the houses
were stencilled eye-bugging portraits of Mussolini,
with hand-painted “vivas,” the double
V in black paint with drippings of paint down
the wall. Side-streets went down to the harbor.
It was bright and the people were all out
for Sunday. The stone paving had been sprinkled
and there were damp stretches in the dust.
We went close to the curb to avoid a tram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s eat somewhere simple,” Guy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stopped opposite two restaurant signs.
We were standing across the street and I was
buying the papers. The two restaurants were
side by side. A woman standing in the doorway
of one smiled at us and we crossed the street
and went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dark inside and at the back of the room
three girls were sitting at a table with an old
woman. Across from us, at another table, sat a
sailor. He sat there neither eating nor drinking.
Further back, a young man in a blue suit
was writing at a table. His hair was pomaded
and shining and he was very smartly dressed
and clean-cut looking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light came through the doorway, and
through the window where vegetables, fruit,
steaks, and chops were arranged in a show-case.
A girl came and took our order and another
girl stood in the doorway. We noticed that she
wore nothing under her house dress. The girl
who took our order put her arm around Guy’s
neck while we were looking at the menu. There
were three girls in all, and they all took turns
going and standing in the doorway. The old
woman at the table in the back of the room
spoke to them and they sat down again with
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doorway leading from the
room except into the kitchen. A curtain hung
over it. The girl who had taken our order
came in from the kitchen with spaghetti. She
put it on the table and brought a bottle of red
wine and sat down at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said to Guy, “you wanted to eat
some place simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t simple. This is complicated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you say?” asked the girl. “Are
you Germans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“South Germans,” I said. “The South Germans
are a gentle, lovable people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t understand,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the mechanics of this place?” Guy
asked. “Do I have to let her put her arm
around my neck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” I said. “Mussolini has abolished
the brothels. This is a restaurant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl wore a one-piece dress. She
leaned forward against the table and put her
hands on her breasts and smiled. She smiled
better on one side than on the other and turned
the good side toward us. The charm of the
good side had been enhanced by some event
which had smoothed the other side of her nose
in, as warm wax can be smoothed. Her nose,
however, did not look like warm wax. It was
very cold and firmed, only smoothed in. “You
like me?” she asked Guy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He adores you,” I said. “But he doesn’t
speak Italian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ich spreche Deutsch,” she said, and stroked
Guy’s hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak to the lady in your native tongue,
Guy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you come from?” asked the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Potsdam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will stay here now for a little
while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this so dear Spezia?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her we have to go,” said Guy. “Tell
her we are very ill, and have no money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend is a misogynist,” I said, “an
old German misogynist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him I love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you shut your mouth and get us out of
here?” Guy said. The lady had placed another
arm around his neck. “Tell him he is mine,”
she said. I told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you get us out of here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are quarrelling,” the lady said. “You
do not love one another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are Germans,” I said proudly, “old
South Germans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him he is a beautiful boy,” the lady
said. Guy is thirty-eight and takes some pride
in the fact that he is taken for a travelling salesman
in France. “You are a beautiful boy,” I
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says so?” Guy asked, “you or her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She does. I’m just your interpreter. Isn’t
that what you got me in on this trip for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad it’s her,” said Guy. “I didn’t want
to have to leave you here too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Spezia’s a lovely place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spezia,” the lady said. “You are talking
about Spezia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovely place,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my country,” she said. “Spezia is my
home and Italy is my country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She says that Italy is her country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her it looks like her country,” Guy
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you for dessert?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fruit,” she said. “We have bananas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bananas are all right,” Guy said. “They’ve
got skins on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he takes bananas,” the lady said. She
embraced Guy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does she say?” he asked, keeping his
face out of the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is pleased because you take bananas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I don’t take bananas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Signor does not take bananas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said the lady, crestfallen, “he doesn’t
take bananas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I take a cold bath every morning,”
Guy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Signor takes a cold bath every morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No understand,” the lady said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across from us, the property sailor had not
moved. No one in the place paid any attention
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want the bill,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. You must stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” the clean-cut young man said from
the table where he was writing, “let them go.
These two are worth nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady took my hand. “You won’t stay?
You won’t ask him to stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have to go,” I said. “We have to get
to Pisa, or if possible, Firenze, to-night. We
can amuse ourselves in those cities at the end of
the day. It is now the day. In the day we
must cover distance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To stay a little while is nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To travel is necessary during the light of
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” the clean-cut young man said.
“Don’t bother to talk with these two. I tell you
they are worth nothing and I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring us the bill,” I said. She brought the
bill from the old woman and went back and sat
at the table. Another girl came in from the
kitchen. She walked the length of the room
and stood in the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t bother with these two,” the clean-cut
young man said in a wearied voice. “Come
and eat. They are worth nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We paid the bill and stood up. All the girls,
the old woman, and the clean-cut young man
sat down at table together. The property sailor
sat with his head in his hands. No one had
spoken to him all the time we were at lunch.
The girl brought us our change that the old
woman counted out for her and went back to
her place at the table. We left a tip on the
table and went out. When we were seated in
the car ready to start, the girl came out and
stood in the door. We started and I waved to
her. She did not wave, but stood there looking
after us.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>AFTER THE RAIN</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was raining hard when we passed through
the suburbs of Genoa and, even going very
slowly behind the tram-cars and the motor
trucks, liquid mud splashed on to the sidewalks,
so that people stepped into doorways as they
saw us coming. In San Pier d’Arena, the industrial
suburb outside of Genoa, there is a wide
street with two car-tracks and we drove down
the centre to avoid sending the mud on to the
men going home from work. On our left was
the Mediterranean. There was a big sea running
and waves broke and the wind blew the
spray against the car. A river-bed that, when
we had passed, going into Italy, had been wide,
stony and dry, was running brown, and up to
the banks. The brown water discolored the
sea and as the waves thinned and cleared in
breaking, the light came through the yellow
water and the crests, detached by the wind,
blew across the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big car passed us, going fast, and a sheet of
muddy water rose up and over our wind-shield
and radiator. The automatic wind-shield
cleaner moved back and forth, spreading the
film over the glass. We stopped and ate lunch
at Sestri. There was no heat in the restaurant
and we kept our hats and coats on. We could
see the car outside, through the window. It
was covered with mud and was stopped beside
some boats that had been pulled up beyond the
waves. In the restaurant you could see your
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>pasta asciuta</span> was good; the wine tasted
of alum, and we poured water in it. Afterward
the waiter brought beefsteak and fried potatoes.
A man and a woman sat at the far end of the
restaurant. He was middle-aged and she was
young and wore black. All during the meal she
would blow out her breath in the cold damp
air. The man would look at it and shake his
head. They ate without talking and the man
held her hand under the table. She was good-looking
and they seemed very sad. They had
a travelling-bag with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had the papers and I read the account of
the Shanghai fighting aloud to Guy. After the
meal, he left with the waiter in search for a
place which did not exist in the restaurant, and I
cleaned off the wind-shield, the lights and the
license plates with a rag. Guy came back and
we backed the car out and started. The waiter
had taken him across the road and into an old
house. The people in the house were suspicious
and the waiter had remained with Guy to see
nothing was stolen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Although I don’t know how, me not being a
plumber, they expected me to steal anything,”
Guy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we came up on a headland beyond the
town, the wind struck the car and nearly tipped
it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good it blows us away from the sea,”
Guy said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “they drowned Shelley somewhere
along here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was down by Viareggio,” Guy said.
“Do you remember what we came to this country
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “but we didn’t get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be out of it to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can get past Ventimiglia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see. I don’t like to drive this coast at
night.” It was early afternoon and the sun was
out. Below, the sea was blue with whitecaps
running toward Savona. Back, beyond the cape,
the brown and blue waters joined. Out ahead
of us, a tramp steamer was going up the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you still see Genoa?” Guy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That next big cape ought to put it out of
sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see it a long time yet. I can still see
Portofino Cape behind it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally we could not see Genoa. I looked
back as we came out and there was only the sea,
and below in the bay, a line of beach with fishing-boats
and above, on the side of the hill, a
town and then capes far down the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s gone now,” I said to Guy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s been gone a long time now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we couldn’t be sure till we got way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sign with a picture of an S-turn
and Svolta Pericolosa. The road curved around
the headland and the wind blew through the
crack in the wind-shield. Below the cape was a
flat stretch beside the sea. The wind had dried
the mud and the wheels were beginning to lift
dust. On the flat road we passed a Fascist riding
a bicycle, a heavy revolver in a holster on
his back. He held the middle of the road on
his bicycle and we turned out for him. He
looked up at us as we passed. Ahead there was
a railway crossing, and as we came toward it
the gates went down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we waited, the Fascist came up on his bicycle.
The train went by and Guy started the
engine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” the bicycle man shouted from behind
the car. “Your number’s dirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I got out with a rag. The number had been
cleaned at lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can read it,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot read it. It is dirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wiped it off with the rag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-five lire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” I said. “You could have read it.
It’s only dirty from the state of the roads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t like Italian roads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are dirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty lire.” He spat in the road. “Your
car is dirty and you are dirty too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. And give me a receipt with your
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took out a receipt-book, made in duplicate,
and perforated, so one side could be given
to the customer, and the other side filled in and
kept as a stub. There was no carbon to record
what the customer’s ticket said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me fifty lire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote in indelible pencil, tore out the
slip and handed it to me. I read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is for twenty-five lire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mistake,” he said, and changed the
twenty-five to fifty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now the other side. Make it fifty in
the part you keep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled a beautiful Italian smile and wrote
something on the receipt stub, holding it so I
could not see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” he said, “before your number gets
dirty again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We drove for two hours after it was dark and
slept in Mentone that night. It seemed very
cheerful and clean and sane and lovely. We
had driven from Ventimiglia to Pisa and Florence,
across the Romagna to Rimini, back
through Forli, Imola, Bologna, Parma, Piacenza
and Genoa, to Ventimiglia again. The
whole trip had only taken ten days. Naturally,
in such a short trip, we had no opportunity to

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>How</span> are you going yourself, Jack?” I
asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seen this, Walcott?” he says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just in the gym.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Jack says, “I’m going to need a lot
of luck with that boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t hit you, Jack,” Soldier said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to hell he couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t hit you with a handful of bird-shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bird-shot’d be all right,” Jack says. “I
wouldn’t mind bird-shot any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks easy to hit,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” Jack says, “he ain’t going to last long.
He ain’t going to last like you and me, Jerry.
But right now he’s got everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll left-hand him to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” Jack says. “Sure. I got a chance
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handle him like you handled Kid Lewis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kid Lewis,” Jack said. “That kike!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three of us, Jack Brennan, Soldier Bartlett,
and I were in Handley’s. There were a
couple of broads sitting at the next table to us.
They had been drinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, kike?” one of the broads
says. “What do you mean, kike, you big Irish
bum?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” Jack says. “That’s it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kikes,” this broad goes on. “They’re always
talking about kikes, these big Irishmen.
What do you mean, kikes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on. Let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kikes,” this broad goes on. “Whoever saw
you ever buy a drink? Your wife sews your
pockets up every morning. These Irishmen and
their kikes! Ted Lewis could lick you too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” Jack says. “And you give away a lot
of things free too, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went out. That was Jack. He could say
what he wanted to when he wanted to say it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack started training out at Danny Hogan’s
health-farm over in Jersey. It was nice out
there but Jack didn’t like it much. He didn’t
like being away from his wife and the kids, and
he was sore and grouchy most of the time. He
liked me and we got along fine together; and he
liked Hogan, but after a while Soldier Bartlett
commenced to get on his nerves. A kidder gets
to be an awful thing around a camp if his stuff
goes sort of sour. Soldier was always kidding
Jack, just sort of kidding him all the time. It
wasn’t very funny and it wasn’t very good, and
it began to get to Jack. It was sort of stuff like
this. Jack would finish up with the weights and
the bag and pull on the gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to work?” he’d say to Soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. How you want me to work?” Soldier
would ask. “Want me to treat you rough
like Walcott? Want me to knock you down
a few times?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it,” Jack would say. He didn’t like
it any, though.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning we were all out on the road.
We’d been out quite a way and now we were
coming back. We’d go along fast for three
minutes and then walk a minute, and then go
fast for three minutes again. Jack wasn’t ever
what you would call a sprinter. He’d move
around fast enough in the ring if he had to,
but he wasn’t any too fast on the road. All the
time we were walking Soldier was kidding him.
We came up the hill to the farmhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” says Jack, “you better go back to
town, Soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You better go back to town and stay there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sick of hearing you talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” says Soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” says Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be a damn sight sicker when Walcott
gets through with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” says Jack, “maybe I will. But I
know I’m sick of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Soldier went off on the train to town that
same morning. I went down with him to the
train. He was good and sore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just kidding him,” he said. We were
waiting on the platform. “He can’t pull that
stuff with me, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s nervous and crabby,” I said. “He’s a
good fellow, Soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hell he is. The hell he’s ever been a
good fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “so long, Soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train had come in. He climbed up with
his bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long, Jerry,” he says. “You be in town
before the fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See you then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went in and the conductor swung up and
the train went out. I rode back to the farm in
the cart. Jack was on the porch writing a letter
to his wife. The mail had come and I got the
papers and went over on the other side of the
porch and sat down to read. Hogan came out
the door and walked over to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he have a jam with Soldier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a jam,” I said. “He just told him to
go back to town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could see it coming,” Hogan said. “He
never liked Soldier much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He don’t like many people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a pretty cold one,” Hogan said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’s always been fine to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me too,” Hogan said. “I got no kick on
him. He’s a cold one, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogan went in through the screen door and
I sat there on the porch and read the papers.
It was just starting to get fall weather and it’s
nice country there in Jersey, up in the hills, and
after I read the paper through I sat there and
looked out at the country and the road down
below against the woods with cars going along it,
lifting the dust up. It was fine weather and
pretty nice-looking country. Hogan came to
the door and I said, “Say, Hogan, haven’t you
got anything to shoot out here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Hogan said. “Only sparrows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seen the paper?” I said to Hogan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sande booted three of them in yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got that on the telephone last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You follow them pretty close, Hogan?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I keep in touch with them,” Hogan
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about Jack?” I says. “Does he still
play them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him?” said Hogan. “Can you see him doing
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Jack came around the corner with
the letter in his hand. He’s wearing a sweater
and an old pair of pants and boxing shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got a stamp, Hogan?” he asks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the letter,” Hogan said. “I’ll mail
it for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Jack,” I said, “didn’t you used to play
the ponies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you did. I knew I used to see you
out at Sheepshead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you lay off them for?” Hogan
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lost money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack sat down on the porch by me. He leaned
back against a post. He shut his eyes in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want a chair?” Hogan asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Jack. “This is fine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a nice day,” I said. “It’s pretty nice
out in the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d a damn sight rather be in town with the
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you only got another week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Jack says. “That’s so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sat there on the porch. Hogan was inside
at the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think about the shape I’m in?”
Jack asked me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t tell,” I said. “You got a
week to get around into form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t stall me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “you’re not right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sleeping,” Jack said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be all right in a couple of days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” says Jack, “I got the insomnia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s on your mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I miss the wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have her come out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I’m too old for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take a long walk before you turn in
and get you good and tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired!” Jack says. “I’m tired all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was that way all week. He wouldn’t
sleep at night and he’d get up in the morning
feeling that way, you know, when you can’t shut
your hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s stale as poorhouse cake,” Hogan said.
“He’s nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never seen Walcott,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll kill him,” said Hogan. “He’ll tear
him in two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “everybody’s got to get it
sometime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not like this, though,” Hogan said.
“They’ll think he never trained. It gives the
farm a black eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hear what the reporters said about
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I! They said he was awful. They
said they oughtn’t to let him fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “they’re always wrong, ain’t
they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Hogan. “But this time they’re
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell do they know about whether
a man’s right or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Hogan, “they’re not such
fools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All they did was pick Willard at Toledo.
This Lardner, he’s so wise now, ask him about
when he picked Willard at Toledo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, he wasn’t out,” Hogan said. “He only
writes the big fights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care who they are,” I said. “What
the hell do they know? They can write maybe,
but what the hell do they know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t think Jack’s in any shape, do
you?” Hogan asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He’s through. All he needs is to have
Corbett pick him to win for it to be all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Corbett’ll pick him,” Hogan says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. He’ll pick him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Jack didn’t sleep any either. The
next morning was the last day before the fight.
After breakfast we were out on the porch again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think about, Jack, when you
can’t sleep?” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I worry,” Jack says. “I worry about
property I got up in the Bronx, I worry about
property I got in Florida. I worry about the
kids. I worry about the wife. Sometimes I
think about fights. I think about that kike Ted
Lewis and I get sore. I got some stocks and I
worry about them. What the hell don’t I think
about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “to-morrow night it’ll all be
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said Jack. “That always helps a lot,
don’t it? That just fixes everything all up, I
suppose. Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sore all day. We didn’t do any work.
Jack just moved around a little to loosen up.
He shadow-boxed a few rounds. He didn’t even
look good doing that. He skipped the rope a
little while. He couldn’t sweat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d be better not to do any work at all,”
Hogan said. We were standing watching him
skip rope. “Don’t he ever sweat at all any
more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t sweat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose he’s got the con? He never
had any trouble making weight, did he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he hasn’t got any con. He just hasn’t
got anything inside any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ought to sweat,” said Hogan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack came over, skipping the rope. He was
skipping up and down in front of us, forward
and back, crossing his arms every third time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he says. “What are you buzzards
talking about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you ought to work any more,”
Hogan says. “You’ll be stale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t that be awful?” Jack says and
skips away down the floor, slapping the rope
hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon John Collins showed up out
at the farm. Jack was up in his room. John,
came out in a car from town. He had a couple
of friends with him. The car stopped and they
all got out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Jack?” John asked me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up in his room, lying down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lying down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at the two fellows that were with
John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re friends of his,” John said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s pretty bad,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He don’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell,” said John. “That Irishman could
never sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He isn’t right,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell,” John said. “He’s never right. I’ve
had him for ten years and he’s never been right
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fellows who were with him laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to shake hands with Mr. Morgan
and Mr. Steinfelt,” John said. “This is Mr.
Doyle. He’s been training Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to meet you,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go up and see the boy,” the fellow
called Morgan said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have a look at him,” Steinfelt said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all went upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Hogan?” John asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s out in the barn with a couple of his
customers,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He got many people out here now?” John
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty quiet, ain’t it?” Morgan said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said. “It’s pretty quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were outside Jack’s room. John knocked
on the door. There wasn’t any answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’s asleep,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell’s he sleeping in the daytime
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John turned the handle and we all went in.
Jack was lying asleep on the bed. He was face
down and his face was in the pillow. Both his
arms were around the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Jack!” John said to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack’s head moved a little on the pillow.
“Jack!” John says, leaning over him. Jack
just dug a little deeper in the pillow. John
touched him on the shoulder. Jack sat up and
looked at us. He hadn’t shaved and he was
wearing an old sweater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christ! Why can’t you let me sleep?” he
says to John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be sore,” John says. “I didn’t mean
to wake you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no,” Jack says. “Of course not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know Morgan and Steinfelt,” John
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad to see you,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you feel, Jack,” Morgan asks him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine,” Jack says. “How the hell would
I feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look fine,” Steinfelt says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, don’t I,” says Jack. “Say,” he says
to John. “You’re my manager. You get a
big enough cut. Why the hell don’t you come
out here when the reporters was out! You want
Jerry and me to talk to them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had Lew fighting in Philadelphia,” John
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell’s that to me?” Jack says.
“You’re my manager. You get a big enough
cut, don’t you? You aren’t making me any
money in Philadelphia, are you? Why the
hell aren’t you out here when I ought to have
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hogan was here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hogan,” Jack says. “Hogan’s as dumb as
I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soldier Bathlett was out here wukking with
you for a while, wasn’t he?” Steinfelt said to
change the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he was out here,” Jack says. “He was
out here all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Jerry,” John said to me. “Would you
go and find Hogan and tell him we want to see
him in about half an hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why the hell can’t he stick around?” Jack
says. “Stick around, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morgan and Steinfelt looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet down, Jack,” John said to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I better go find Hogan,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, if you want to go,” Jack says.
“None of these guys are going to send you
away, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go find Hogan,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogan was out in the gym in the barn. He
had a couple of his health-farm patients with
the gloves on. They neither one wanted to hit
the other, for fear the other would come back
and hit him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll do,” Hogan said when he saw me
come in. “You can stop the slaughter. You
gentlemen take a shower and Bruce will rub you
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed out through the ropes and
Hogan came over to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John Collins is out with a couple of friends
to see Jack,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw them come up in the car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are the two fellows with John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re what you call wise boys,” Hogan
said. “Don’t you know them two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Happy Steinfelt and Lew Morgan.
They got a pool-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I been away a long time,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said Hogan. “That Happy Steinfelt’s
a big operator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard his name,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a pretty smooth boy,” Hogan said.
“They’re a couple of sharpshooters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said. “They want to see us in half
an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean they don’t want to see us until a
half an hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on in the office,” Hogan said. “To
hell with those sharpshooters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After about thirty minutes or so Hogan and
I went upstairs. We knocked on Jack’s door.
They were talking inside the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute,” somebody said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To hell with that stuff,” Hogan said.
“When you want to see me I’m down in the
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We heard the door unlock. Steinfelt opened
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on in, Hogan,” he says. “We’re all
going to have a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” says Hogan. “That’s something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went in. Jack was sitting on the bed.
John and Morgan were sitting on a couple of
chairs. Steinfelt was standing up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a pretty mysterious lot of boys,”
Hogan said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Danny,” John says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Danny,” Morgan says and shakes
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack doesn’t say anything. He just sits there
on the bed. He ain’t with the others. He’s all
by himself. He was wearing an old blue jersey
and pants and had on boxing shoes. He
needed a shave. Steinfelt and Morgan were
dressers. John was quite a dresser too. Jack
sat there looking Irish and tough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steinfelt brought out a bottle and Hogan
brought in some glasses and everybody had a
drink. Jack and I took one and the rest of them
went on and had two or three each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better save some for your ride back,” Hogan
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you worry. We got plenty,” Morgan
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack hadn’t drunk anything since the one
drink. He was standing up and looking at them.
Morgan was sitting on the bed where Jack had
sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a drink, Jack,” John said and handed
him the glass and the bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Jack said, “I never liked to go to these
wakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all laughed. Jack didn’t laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all feeling pretty good when they
left. Jack stood on the porch when they got
into the car. They waved to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long,” Jack said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had supper. Jack didn’t say anything all
during the meal except, “Will you pass me
this?” or “Will you pass me that?” The two
health-farm patients ate at the same table with
us. They were pretty nice fellows. After we
finished eating we went out on the porch. It
was dark early.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like to take a walk, Jerry?” Jack asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We put on our coats and started out. It was
quite a way down to the main road and then we
walked along the main road about a mile and a
half. Cars kept going by and we would pull
out to the side until they were past. Jack didn’t
say anything. After we had stepped out into
the bushes to let a big car go by Jack said, “To
hell with this walking. Come on back to Hogan’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went along a side road that cut up over
the hill and cut across the fields back to Hogan’s.
We could see the lights of the house up
on the hill. We came around to the front of
the house and there standing in the doorway
was Hogan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a good walk?” Hogan asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fine,” Jack said. “Listen, Hogan.
Have you got any liquor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” says Hogan. “What’s the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send it up to the room,” Jack says. “I’m
going to sleep to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the doctor,” Hogan says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on up to the room, Jerry,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upstairs Jack sat on the bed with his head in
his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ain’t it a life?” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogan brought in a quart of liquor and two
glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want some ginger-ale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think I want to do, get sick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just asked you,” said Hogan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a drink?” said Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks,” said Hogan. He went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about you, Jerry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have one with you,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack poured out a couple of drinks. “Now,”
he said, “I want to take it slow and easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put some water in it,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Jack said. “I guess that’s better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a couple of drinks without saying
anything. Jack started to pour me another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said, “that’s all I want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Jack said. He poured himself
out another big shot and put water in it. He
was lighting up a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a fine bunch out here this afternoon,”
he said. “They don’t take any chances,
those two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a little later, “Well,” he says, “they’re
right. What the hell’s the good in taking
chances?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you want another, Jerry?” he said.
“Come on, drink along with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t need it, Jack,” I said. “I feel all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just have one more,” Jack said. It was
softening him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack poured one for me and another big one
for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” he said, “I like liquor pretty
well. If I hadn’t been boxing I would have
drunk quite a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” he said, “I missed a lot, boxing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You made plenty of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, that’s what I’m after. You know I
miss a lot, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he says, “like about the wife. And
being away from home so much. It don’t do
my girls any good. ‘Whose your old man?’
some of those society kids’ll say to them. ‘My
old man’s Jack Brennan.’ That don’t do them
any good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell,” I said, “all that makes a difference
is if they got dough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” says Jack, “I got the dough for them
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He poured out another drink. The bottle
was about empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put some water in it,” I said. Jack poured
in some water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” he says, “you ain’t got any idea
how I miss the wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t got any idea. You can’t have an
idea what it’s like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ought to be better out in the country than
in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With me now,” Jack said, “it don’t make
any difference where I am. You can’t have an
idea what it’s like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have another drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I getting soused? Do I talk funny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re coming on all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t have an idea what it’s like. They
ain’t anybody can have an idea what it’s like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except the wife,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows,” Jack said. “She knows all
right. She knows. You bet she knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put some water in that,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jerry,” says Jack, “you can’t have an idea
what it gets to be like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was good and drunk. He was looking at
me steady. His eyes were sort of too steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll sleep all right,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Jerry,” Jack says. “You want to
make some money? Get some money down on
Walcott.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Jerry,” Jack put down the glass.
“I’m not drunk now, see? You know what I’m
betting on him? Fifty grand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a lot of dough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty grand,” Jack says, “at two to one. I’ll
get twenty-five thousand bucks. Get some
money on him, Jerry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds good,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I beat him?” Jack says. “It ain’t
crooked. How can I beat him? Why not make
money on it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put some water in that,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m through after this fight,” Jack says.
“I’m through with it. I got to take a beating.
Why shouldn’t I make money on it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t slept for a week,” Jack says. “All
night I lay awake and worry my can off. I
can’t sleep, Jerry. You ain’t got an idea what
it’s like when you can’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t sleep. That’s all. I just can’t sleep.
What’s the use of taking care of yourself all
these years when you can’t sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t got an idea what it’s like, Jerry,
when you can’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put some water in that,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, about eleven o’clock Jack passes out
and I put him to bed. Finally he’s so he can’t
keep from sleeping. I helped him get his
clothes off and got him into bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll sleep all right, Jack,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” Jack says, “I’ll sleep now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Jack,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Jerry,” Jack says. “You’re the
only friend I got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hell,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the only friend I got,” Jack says,
“the only friend I got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to sleep,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll sleep,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Downstairs Hogan was sitting at the desk
in the office reading the papers. He looked up.
“Well, you get your boy friend to sleep?” he
asks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s better for him than not sleeping,” Hogan
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have a hell of a time explaining that
to these sport writers though,” Hogan said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m going to bed myself,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night,” said Hogan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning I came downstairs about eight
o’clock and got some breakfast. Hogan had
his two customers out in the barn doing exercises.
I went out and watched them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One! Two! Three! Four!” Hogan was
counting for them. “Hello, Jerry,” he said.
“Is Jack up yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He’s still sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went back to my room and packed up to go
in to town. About nine-thirty I heard Jack
getting up in the next room. When I heard
him go downstairs I went down after him.
Jack was sitting at the breakfast table. Hogan
had come in and was standing beside the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you feel, Jack?” I asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sleep well?” Hogan asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I slept all right,” Jack said. “I got a thick
tongue but I ain’t got a head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said Hogan. “That was good
liquor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put it on the bill,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What time you want to go into town?”
Hogan asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before lunch,” Jack says. “The eleven
o’clock train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Jerry,” Jack said. Hogan went
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat down at the table. Jack was eating a
grape-fruit. When he’d find a seed he’d spit
it out in the spoon and dump it on the plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I was pretty stewed last night,” he
started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You drank some liquor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess I said a lot of fool things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Hogan?” he asked. He was
through with the grape-fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s out in front in the office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I say about betting on the fight?”
Jack asked. He was holding the spoon and
sort of poking at the grape-fruit with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl came in with some ham and eggs
and took away the grape-fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me another glass of milk,” Jack said
to her. She went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you had fifty grand on Walcott,”
I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” Jack said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a lot of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t feel too good about it,” Jack said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something might happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Jack said. “He wants the title bad.
They’ll be shooting with him all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t ever tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He wants the title. It’s worth a lot
of money to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty grand is a lot of money,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s business,” said Jack. “I can’t win. You
know I can’t win anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As long as you’re in there you got a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Jack says. “I’m all through. It’s
just business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty good,” Jack said. “The sleep was
what I needed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might go good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give them a good show,” Jack said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast Jack called up his wife on
the long-distance. He was inside the booth
telephoning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the first time he’s called her up
since he’s out here,” Hogan said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He writes her every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” Hogan says, “a letter only costs
two cents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hogan said good-by to us and Bruce, the
nigger rubber, drove us down to the train in the
cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-by, Mr. Brennan,” Bruce said at the
train, “I sure hope you knock his can off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long,” Jack said. He gave Bruce two
dollars. Bruce had worked on him a lot. He
looked kind of disappointed. Jack saw me looking
at Bruce holding the two dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all in the bill,” he said. “Hogan
charged me for the rubbing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the train going into town Jack didn’t talk.
He sat in the corner of the seat with his ticket
in his hat-band and looked out of the window.
Once he turned and spoke to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told the wife I’d take a room at the Shelby
to-night,” he said. “It’s just around the corner
from the Garden. I can go up to the house to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good idea,” I said. “Your wife
ever see you fight, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Jack says. “She never seen me fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought he must be figuring on taking an
awful beating if he doesn’t want to go home
afterward. In town we took a taxi up to the
Shelby. A boy came out and took our bags and
we went in to the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much are the rooms?” Jack asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We only have double rooms,” the clerk
says. “I can give you a nice double room for
ten dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s too steep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can give you a double room for seven
dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a bath?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might as well bunk with me, Jerry,”
Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” I said, “I’ll sleep down at my brother-in-law’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean for you to pay it,” Jack says.
“I just want to get my money’s worth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you register, please?” the clerk says.
He looked at the names. “Number 238,
Mister Brennan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went up in the elevator. It was a nice
big room with two beds and a door opening into
a bath-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is pretty good,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy who brought us up pulled up the
curtains and brought in our bags. Jack didn’t
make any move, so I gave the boy a quarter.
We washed up and Jack said we better go out
and get something to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ate a lunch at Jimmey Handley’s place.
Quite a lot of the boys were there. When we
were about half through eating, John came in
and sat down with us. Jack didn’t talk much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you on the weight, Jack?” John
asked him. Jack was putting away a pretty
good lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could make it with my clothes on,” Jack
said. He never had to worry about taking off
weight. He was a natural welter-weight and
he’d never gotten fat. He’d lost weight out at
Hogan’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s one thing you never had to
worry about,” John said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s one thing,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went around to the garden to weigh in
after lunch. The match was made at a hundred
forty-seven pounds at three o’clock. Jack
stepped on the scales with a towel around him.
The bar didn’t move. Walcott had just weighed
and was standing with a lot of people around
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s see what you weigh, Jack,” Freedman,
Walcott’s manager said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, weigh <span class='it'>him</span> then,” Jack jerked his
head toward Walcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop the towel,” Freedman said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you make it?” Jack asked the fellows
who were weighing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One hundred and forty-three pounds,” the
fat man who was weighing said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re down fine, Jack,” Freedman says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weigh <span class='it'>him</span>,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walcott came over. He was a blond with
wide shoulders and arms like a heavyweight.
He didn’t have much legs. Jack stood about
half a head taller than he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Jack,” he said. His face was plenty
marked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” said Jack. “How you feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” Walcott says. He dropped the
towel from around his waist and stood on the
scales. He had the widest shoulders and back
you ever saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One hundred and forty-six pounds and
twelve ounces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walcott stepped off and grinned at Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” John says to him, “Jack’s spotting
you about four pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More than that when I come in, kid,” Walcott
says. “I’m going to go and eat now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went back and Jack got dressed. “He’s
a pretty tough-looking boy,” Jack says to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looks as though he’d been hit plenty of
times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Jack says. “He ain’t hard to hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?” John asked when
Jack was dressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back to the hotel,” Jack says. “You looked
after everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” John says. “It’s all looked after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to lie down a while,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come around for you about a quarter to
seven and we’ll go and eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up at the hotel Jack took off his shoes and
his coat and lay down for a while. I wrote a
letter. I looked over a couple of times and
Jack wasn’t sleeping. He was lying perfectly
still but every once in a while his eyes would
open. Finally he sits up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to play some cribbage, Jerry?” he
says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went over to his suitcase and got out
the cards and the cribbage board. We played
cribbage and he won three dollars off me. John
knocked at the door and came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to play some cribbage, John?” Jack
asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John put his kelly down on the table. It
was all wet. His coat was wet too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it raining?” Jack asks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pouring,” John says. “The taxi I had,
got tied up in the traffic and I got out and
walked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, play some cribbage,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to go and eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” says Jack. “I don’t want to eat yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they played cribbage for about half an
hour and Jack won a dollar and a half off him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose we got to go eat,” Jack
says. He went to the window and looked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it still raining?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s eat in the hotel,” John says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Jack says, “I’ll play you once
more to see who pays for the meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little while Jack gets up and says,
“You buy the meal, John,” and we went downstairs
and ate in the big dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we ate we went upstairs and Jack
played cribbage with John again and won two
dollars and a half off him. Jack was feeling
pretty good. John had a bag with him with all
his stuff in it. Jack took off his shirt and collar
and put on a jersey and a sweater, so he
wouldn’t catch cold when he came out, and put
his ring clothes and his bathrobe in a bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You all ready?” John asks him. “I’ll call
up and have them get a taxi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pretty soon the telephone rang and they said
the taxi was waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rode down in the elevator and went out
through the lobby, and got in a taxi and rode
around to the Garden. It was raining hard but
there was a lot of people outside on the streets.
The Garden was sold out. As we came in on our
way to the dressing-room I saw how full it was.
It looked like half a mile down to the ring. It
was all dark. Just the lights over the ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a good thing, with this rain, they didn’t
try and pull this fight in the ball park,” John
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got a good crowd,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a fight that would draw a lot more
than the Garden could hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t tell about the weather,” Jack
says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John came to the door of the dressing-room
and poked his head in. Jack was sitting there
with his bathrobe on, he had his arms folded
and was looking at the floor. John had a couple
of handlers with him. They looked over his
shoulder. Jack looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he in?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s just gone down,” John said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We started down. Walcott was just getting
into the ring. The crowd gave him a big hand.
He climbed through between the ropes and put
his two fists together and smiled, and shook
them at the crowd, first at one side of the ring,
then at the other, and then sat down. Jack got
a good hand coming down through the crowd.
Jack is Irish and the Irish always get a pretty
good hand. An Irishman don’t draw in New
York like a Jew or an Italian but they always
get a good hand. Jack climbed up and bent
down to go through the ropes and Walcott came
over from his corner and pushed the rope down
for Jack to go through. The crowd thought
that was wonderful. Walcott put his hand on
Jack’s shoulder and they stood there just for
a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re going to be one of these popular
champions,” Jack says to him. “Take your
goddam hand off my shoulder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be yourself,” Walcott says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is all great for the crowd. How gentlemanly
the boys are before the fight! How
they wish each other luck!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solly Freedman came over to our corner
while Jack is bandaging his hands and John is
over in Walcott’s corner. Jack puts his thumb
through the slit in the bandage and then
wrapped his hand nice and smooth. I taped it
around the wrist and twice across the knuckles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey,” Freedman says. “Where do you
get all that tape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feel of it,” Jack says. “It’s soft, ain’t it?
Don’t be a hick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freedman stands there all the time while
Jack bandages the other hand, and one of the
boys that’s going to handle him brings the
gloves and I pull them on and work them
around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Freedman,” Jack asks, “what nationality
is this Walcott?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Solly says. “He’s some sort
of a Dane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a Bohemian,” the lad who brought the
gloves said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The referee called them out to the centre
of the ring and Jack walks out. Walcott comes
out smiling. They met and the referee put his
arm on each of their shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, popularity,” Jack says to Walcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call yourself ‘Walcott’ for?”
Jack says. “Didn’t you know he was a nigger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen—” says the referee, and he gives
them the same old line. Once Walcott interrupts
him. He grabs Jack’s arm and says, “Can
I hit when he’s got me like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your hands off me,” Jack says. “There
ain’t no moving-pictures of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went back to their corners. I lifted the
bathrobe off Jack and he leaned on the ropes and
flexed his knees a couple of times and scuffed
his shoes in the rosin. The gong rang and
Jack turned quick and went out. Walcott came
toward him and they touched gloves and as
soon as Walcott dropped his hands Jack jumped
his left into his face twice. There wasn’t anybody
ever boxed better than Jack. Walcott was
after him, going forward all the time with his
chin on his chest. He’s a hooker and he carries
his hands pretty low. All he knows is to
get in there and sock. But every time he gets
in there close, Jack has the left hand in his face.
It’s just as though it’s automatic. Jack just
raises the left hand up and it’s in Walcott’s face.
Three or four times Jack brings the right over
but Walcott gets it on the shoulder or high up
on the head. He’s just like all these hookers.
The only thing he’s afraid of is another one of
the same kind. He’s covered everywhere you
can hurt him. He don’t care about a left-hand
in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After about four rounds Jack has him bleeding
bad and his face all cut up, but every time
Walcott’s got in close he’s socked so hard he’s
got two big red patches on both sides just below
Jack’s ribs. Every time he gets in close, Jack
ties him up, then gets one hand loose and uppercuts
him, but when Walcott gets his hands
loose he socks Jack in the body so they can hear
it outside in the street. He’s a socker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It goes along like that for three rounds more.
They don’t talk any. They’re working all the
time. We worked over Jack plenty too, in between
the rounds. He don’t look good at all
but he never does much work in the ring. He
don’t move around much and that left-hand is
just automatic. It’s just like it was connected
with Walcott’s face and Jack just had to wish
it in every time. Jack is always calm in close
and he doesn’t waste any juice. He knows
everything about working in close too and he’s
getting away with a lot of stuff. While they
were in our corner I watched him tie Walcott
up, get his right hand loose, turn it and come
up with an uppercut that got Walcott’s nose
with the heel of the glove. Walcott was bleeding
bad and leaned his nose on Jack’s shoulder
so as to give Jack some of it too, and Jack sort
of lifted his shoulder sharp and caught him
against the nose, and then brought down the
right hand and did the same thing again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walcott was sore as hell. By the time they’d
gone five rounds he hated Jack’s guts. Jack
wasn’t sore; that is, he wasn’t any sorer than he
always was. He certainly did used to make the
fellows he fought hate boxing. That was why
he hated Kid Lewis so. He never got the Kid’s
goat. Kid Lewis always had about three new
dirty things Jack couldn’t do. Jack was as safe
as a church all the time he was in there, as long
as he was strong. He certainly was treating
Walcott rough. The funny thing was it looked
as though Jack was an open classic boxer. That
was because he had all that stuff too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the seventh round Jack says, “My
left’s getting heavy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From then he started to take a beating. It
didn’t show at first. But instead of him running
the fight it was Walcott was running it, instead
of being safe all the time now he was in trouble.
He couldn’t keep him out with the left hand
now. It looked as though it was the same as
ever, only now instead of Walcott’s punches
just missing him they were just hitting him.
He took an awful beating in the body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the round?” Jack asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The eleventh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t stay,” Jack says. “My legs are going
bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walcott had been just hitting him for a long
time. It was like a baseball catcher pulls the
ball and takes some of the shock off. From
now on Walcott commenced to land solid. He
certainly was a socking-machine. Jack was just
trying to block everything now. It didn’t show
what an awful beating he was taking. In between
the rounds I worked on his legs. The
muscles would flutter under my hands all the
time I was rubbing them. He was sick as hell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s it go?” he asked John, turning
around, his face all swollen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s his fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I can last,” Jack says. “I don’t want
this bohunk to stop me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was going just the way he thought it
would. He knew he couldn’t beat Walcott. He
wasn’t strong any more. He was all right
though. His money was all right and now he
wanted to finish it off right to please himself.
He didn’t want to be knocked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gong rang and we pushed him out. He
went out slow. Walcott came right out after
him. Jack put the left in his face and Walcott
took it, came in under it and started working on
Jack’s body. Jack tried to tie him up and it was
just like trying to hold on to a buzz-saw. Jack
broke away from it and missed with the right.
Walcott clipped him with a left-hook and Jack
went down. He went down on his hands and
knees and looked at us. The referee started
counting. Jack was watching us and shaking his
head. At eight John motioned to him. You
couldn’t hear on account of the crowd. Jack
got up. The referee had been holding Walcott
back with one arm while he counted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jack was on his feet Walcott started
toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch yourself, Jimmy,” I heard Solly
Freedman yell to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walcott came up to Jack looking at him.
Jack stuck the left hand at him. Walcott just
shook his head. He backed Jack up against the
ropes, measured him and then hooked the left
very light to the side of Jack’s head and socked
the right into the body as hard as he could sock,
just as low as he could get it. He must have
hit him five inches below the belt. I thought
the eyes would come out of Jack’s head. They
stuck way out. His mouth come open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The referee grabbed Walcott. Jack stepped
forward. If he went down there went fifty
thousand bucks. He walked as though all his
insides were going to fall out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t low,” he said. “It was a accident.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd were yelling so you couldn’t hear
anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all right,” Jack says. They were right
in front of us. The referee looks at John and
then he shakes his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, you polak son-of-a-bitch,” Jack
says to Walcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John was hanging onto the ropes. He had
the towel ready to chuck in. Jack was standing
just a little way out from the ropes. He took
a step forward. I saw the sweat come out on his
face like somebody had squeezed it and a big
drop went down his nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on and fight,” Jack says to Walcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The referee looked at John and waved Walcott
on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go in there, you slob,” he says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walcott went in. He didn’t know what to
do either. He never thought Jack could have
stood it. Jack put the left in his face. There
was such a hell of a lot of yelling going on.
They were right in front of us. Walcott hit
him twice. Jack’s face was the worst thing I
ever saw,—the look on it! He was holding
himself and all his body together and it all
showed on his face. All the time he was thinking
and holding his body in where it was busted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he started to sock. His face looked
awful all the time. He started to sock with his
hands low down by his side, swinging at Walcott.
Walcott covered up and Jack was swinging
wild at Walcott’s head. Then he swung the
left and it hit Walcott in the groin and the right
hit Walcott right bang where he’d hit Jack.
Way low below the belt. Walcott went down
and grabbed himself there and rolled and
twisted around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The referee grabbed Jack and pushed him toward
his corner. John jumps into the ring.
There was all this yelling going on. The
referee was talking with the judges and then the
announcer got into the ring with the megaphone
and says, “Walcott on a foul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The referee is talking to John and he says,
“What could I do? Jack wouldn’t take the
foul. Then when he’s groggy he fouls him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d lost it anyway,” John says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack’s sitting on the chair. I’ve got his gloves
off and he’s holding himself in down there with
both hands. When he’s got something supporting
it his face doesn’t look so bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go over and say you’re sorry,” John says
into his ear. “It’ll look good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack stands up and the sweat comes out all
over his face. I put the bathrobe around him
and he holds himself in with one hand under
the bathrobe and goes across the ring. They’ve
picked Walcott up and they’re working on him.
There’re a lot of people in Walcott’s corner.
Nobody speaks to Jack. He leans over Walcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” Jack says. “I didn’t mean to
foul you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Walcott doesn’t say anything. He looks too
damned sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re the champion now,” Jack says
to him. “I hope you get a hell of a lot of fun
out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave the kid alone,” Solly Freedman says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Solly,” Jack says. “I’m sorry I
fouled your boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Freedman just looks at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack went to his corner walking that funny
jerky way and we got him down through the
ropes and through the reporters’ tables and out
down the aisle. A lot of people want to slap
Jack on the back. He goes out through all
that mob in his bathrobe to the dressing-room.
It’s a popular win for Walcott. That’s the way
the money was bet in the Garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once we got inside the dressing-room Jack
lay down and shut his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want to get to the hotel and get a
doctor,” John says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all busted inside,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry as hell, Jack,” John says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lies there with his eyes shut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They certainly tried a nice double-cross,”
John said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your friends Morgan and Steinfelt,” Jack
said. “You got nice friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lies there, his eyes are open now. His
face has still got that awful drawn look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s funny how fast you can think when it
means that much money,” Jack says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re some boy, Jack,” John says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Jack says. “It was nothing.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>A SIMPLE ENQUIRY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Outside</span>, the snow was higher than the window.
The sunlight came in through the window
and shone on a map on the pine-board wall of
the hut. The sun was high and the light came
in over the top of the snow. A trench had been
cut along the open side of the hut, and each
clear day the sun, shining on the wall, reflected
heat against the snow and widened the trench.
It was late March. The major sat at a table
against the wall. His adjutant sat at another
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around the major’s eyes were two white
circles where his snow-glasses had protected his
face from the sun on the snow. The rest of his
face had been burned and then tanned and then
burned through the tan. His nose was swollen
and there were edges of loose skin where blisters
had been. While he worked at the papers
he put the fingers of his left hand into a saucer
of oil and then spread the oil over his face,
touching it very gently with the tips of his fingers.
He was very careful to drain his fingers
on the edge of the saucer so there was only a
film of oil on them, and after he had stroked
his forehead and his cheeks, he stroked his nose
very delicately between his fingers. When he
had finished he stood up, took the saucer of oil
and went into the small room of the hut where
he slept. “I’m going to take a little sleep,” he
said to the adjutant. In that army an adjutant
is not a commissioned officer. “You will finish
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, signor maggiore,” the adjutant answered.
He leaned back in his chair and
yawned. He took a paper-covered book out of
the pocket of his coat and opened it; then laid
it down on the table and lit his pipe. He leaned
forward on the table to read and puffed at his
pipe. Then he closed the book and put it back
in his pocket. He had too much paper-work to
get through. He could not enjoy reading until
it was done. Outside, the sun went behind a
mountain and there was no more light on the
wall of the hut. A soldier came in and put
some pine branches, chopped into irregular
lengths, into the stove. “Be soft, Pinin,” the
adjutant said to him. “The major is sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinin was the major’s orderly. He was a
dark-faced boy, and he fixed the stove, putting
the pine wood in carefully, shut the door, and
went into the back of the hut again. The adjutant
went on with his papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tonani,” the major called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Signor maggiore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send Pinin in to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pinin!” the adjutant called. Pinin came
into the room. “The major wants you,” the
adjutant said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinin walked across the main room of the
hut toward the major’s door. He knocked on
the half-opened door. “Signor maggiore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” the adjutant heard the major say,
“and shut the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside the room the major lay on his bunk.
Pinin stood beside the bunk. The major lay
with his head on the rucksack that he had
stuffed with spare clothing to make a pillow.
His long, burned, oiled face looked at Pinin.
His hands lay on the blankets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are nineteen?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, signor maggiore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have ever been in love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean, signor maggiore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In love—with a girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been with girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not ask that. I asked if you had been
in love—with a girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, signor maggiore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are in love with this girl now? You
don’t write her. I read all your letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am in love with her,” Pinin said, “but I
do not write her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure of this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tonani,” the major said in the same tone
of voice, “can you hear me talking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer from the next room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can not hear,” the major said. “And
you are quite sure that you love a girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” the major looked at him quickly,
“that you are not corrupt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what you mean, corrupt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” the major said. “You needn’t
be superior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinin looked at the floor. The major looked
at his brown face, down and up him, and at his
hands. Then he went on, not smiling, “And
you don’t really want—” the major paused.
Pinin looked at the floor. “That your great desire
isn’t really—” Pinin looked at the floor.
The major leaned his head back on the rucksack
and smiled. He was really relieved: life in
the army was too complicated. “You’re a good
boy,” he said. “You’re a good boy, Pinin. But
don’t be superior and be careful some one else
doesn’t come along and take you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinin stood still beside the bunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be afraid,” the major said. His hands
were folded on the blankets. “I won’t touch
you. You can go back to your platoon if you
like. But you had better stay on as my servant.
You’ve less chance of being killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want anything of me, signor maggiore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the major said. “Go on and get on
with whatever you were doing. Leave the door
open when you go out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinin went out, leaving the door open. The
adjutant looked up at him as he walked awkwardly
across the room and out the door. Pinin
was flushed and moved differently than he had
moved when he brought in the wood for the
fire. The adjutant looked after him and smiled.
Pinin came in with more wood for the stove.
The major, lying on his bunk, looking at his
cloth-covered helmet and his snow-glasses that
hung from a nail on the wall, heard him walk
across the floor. The little devil, he thought,
I wonder if he lied to me.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>TEN INDIANS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>After</span> one Fourth of July, Nick, driving
home late from town in the big wagon with Joe
Garner and his family, passed nine drunken
Indians along the road. He remembered there
were nine because Joe Garner, driving along in
the dusk, pulled up the horses, jumped down
into the road and dragged an Indian out of the
wheel rut. The Indian had been asleep, face
down in the sand. Joe dragged him into the
bushes and got back up on the wagon-box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes nine of them,” Joe said, “just
between here and the edge of town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them Indians,” said Mrs. Garner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick was on the back seat with the two Garner
boys. He was looking out from the back
seat to see the Indian where Joe had dragged
him alongside of the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it Billy Tabeshaw?” Carl asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His pants looked mighty like Billy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All Indians wear the same kind of pants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t see him at all,” Frank said. “Pa
was down into the road and back up again before
I seen a thing. I thought he was killing a
snake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plenty of Indians’ll kill snakes to-night, I
guess,” Joe Garner said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them Indians,” said Mrs. Garner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove along. The road turned off from
the main highway and went up into the hills.
It was hard pulling for the horses and the boys
got down and walked. The road was sandy.
Nick looked back from the top of the hill by
the schoolhouse. He saw the lights of Petoskey
and, off across Little Traverse Bay, the
lights of Harbour Springs. They climbed back
in the wagon again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They ought to put some gravel on that
stretch,” Joe Garner said. The wagon went
along the road through the woods. Joe and
Mrs. Garner sat close together on the front seat.
Nick sat between the two boys. The road came
out into a clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right here was where Pa ran over the
skunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was further on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It don’t make no difference where it was,”
Joe said without turning his head. “One place
is just as good as another to run over a skunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw two skunks last night,” Nick said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down by the lake. They were looking for
dead fish along the beach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were coons probably,” Carl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were skunks. I guess I know skunks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to,” Carl said. “You got an
Indian girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop talking that way, Carl,” said Mrs.
Garner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they smell about the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joe Garner laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stop laughing, Joe,” Mrs. Garner said.
“I won’t have Carl talk that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got an Indian girl, Nickie?” Joe
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has too, Pa,” Frank said. “Prudence
Mitchell’s his girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He goes to see her every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t.” Nick, sitting between the two boys
in the dark, felt hollow and happy inside himself
to be teased about Prudence Mitchell. “She
ain’t my girl,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to him,” said Carl. “I see them together
every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carl can’t get a girl,” his mother said, “not
even a squaw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carl was quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carl ain’t no good with girls,” Frank said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shut up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re all right, Carl,” Joe Garner said.
“Girls never got a man anywhere. Look at
your pa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what you would say,” Mrs. Garner
moved close to Joe as the wagon jolted.
“Well, you had plenty of girls in your time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet Pa wouldn’t ever have had a squaw
for a girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think it,” Joe said. “You better
watch out to keep Prudie, Nick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife whispered to him and Joe laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you laughing at?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you say it, Garner,” his wife warned.
Joe laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nickie can have Prudence,” Joe Garner said.
“I got a good girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way to talk,” Mrs. Garner said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horses were pulling heavily in the sand.
Joe reached out in the dark with the whip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, pull into it. You’ll have to pull
harder than this to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They trotted down the long hill, the wagon
jolting. At the farmhouse everybody got down.
Mrs. Garner unlocked the door, went inside,
and came out with a lamp in her hand. Carl
and Nick unloaded the things from the back of
the wagon. Frank sat on the front seat to drive
to the barn and put up the horses. Nick went
up the steps and opened the kitchen door. Mrs.
Garner was building a fire in the stove. She
turned from pouring kerosene on the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-by, Mrs. Garner,” Nick said. “Thanks
for taking me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh shucks, Nickie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a wonderful time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We like to have you. Won’t you stay and
eat some supper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I better go. I think Dad probably waited
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, get along then. Send Carl up to the
house, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Nickie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Mrs. Garner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick went out the farmyard and down to the
barn. Joe and Frank were milking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night,” Nick said. “I had a swell
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Nick,” Joe Garner called.
“Aren’t you going to stay and eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t. Will you tell Carl his mother
wants him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Good-night, Nickie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick walked barefoot along the path through
the meadow below the barn. The path was
smooth and the dew was cool on his bare feet.
He climbed a fence at the end of the meadow,
went down through a ravine, his feet wet in
the swamp mud, and then climbed up through
the dry beech woods until he saw the lights of
the cottage. He climbed over the fence and
walked around to the front porch. Through
the window he saw his father sitting by the
table, reading in the light from the big lamp.
Nick opened the door and went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Nickie,” his father said, “was it a
good day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a swell time, Dad. It was a swell
Fourth of July.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hungry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do with your shoes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left them in the wagon at Garner’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on out to the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick’s father went ahead with the lamp. He
stopped and lifted the lid of the ice-box. Nick
went on into the kitchen. His father brought
in a piece of cold chicken on a plate and a pitcher
of milk and put them on the table before Nick.
He put down the lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s some pie too,” he said. “Will that
hold you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s grand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father sat down in a chair beside the oilcloth-covered
table. He made a big shadow on
the kitchen wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who won the ball game?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Petoskey. Five to three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father sat watching him eat and filled
his glass from the milk-pitcher. Nick drank
and wiped his mouth on his napkin. His father
reached over to the shelf for the pie. He cut
Nick a big piece. It was huckleberry pie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do, Dad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went out fishing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you get?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only perch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father sat watching Nick eat the pie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do this afternoon?” Nick
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went for a walk up by the Indian camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see anybody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Indians were all in town getting
drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you see anybody at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw your friend, Prudie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where was she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was in the woods with Frank Washburn.
I ran onto them. They were having
quite a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father was not looking at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were they doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t stay to find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what they were doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” his father said. “I just
heard them threshing around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know it was them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you said you didn’t see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I saw them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was it with her?” Nick asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frank Washburn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were they—were they——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were they what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were they happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father got up from the table and went
out the kitchen screen door. When he came
back Nick was looking at his plate. He had
been crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have some more?” His father picked up
the knife to cut the pie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Nick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You better have another piece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t want any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father cleared off the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were they in the woods?” Nick
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up back of the camp.” Nick looked at his
plate. His father said, “You better go to bed,
Nick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nick went into his room, undressed, and got
into bed. He heard his father moving around in
the living-room. Nick lay in the bed with his
face in the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart’s broken,” he thought. “If I feel
this way my heart must be broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while he heard his father blow out
the lamp and go into his own room. He heard
a wind come up in the trees outside and felt
it come in cool through the screen. He lay for
a long time with his face in the pillow, and
after a while he forgot to think about Prudence
and finally he went to sleep. When he awoke in
the night he heard the wind in the hemlock
trees outside the cottage and the waves of the
lake coming in on the shore, and he went back
to sleep. In the morning there was a big wind
blowing and the waves were running high up
on the beach and he was awake a long time before
he remembered that his heart was broken.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>A CANARY FOR ONE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> train passed very quickly a long, red
stone house with a garden and four thick palm-trees
with tables under them in the shade. On
the other side was the sea. Then there was a
cutting through red stone and clay, and the sea
was only occasionally and far below against
rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bought him in Palermo,” the American
lady said. “We only had an hour ashore and it
was Sunday morning. The man wanted to be
paid in dollars and I gave him a dollar and a
half. He really sings very beautifully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very hot in the train and it was very
hot in the <span class='it'>lit salon</span> compartment. There was no
breeze came through the open window. The
American lady pulled the window-blind down
and there was no more sea, even occasionally.
On the other side there was glass, then the corridor,
then an open window, and outside the
window were dusty trees and an oiled road and
flat fields of grapes, with gray-stone hills behind
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was smoke from many tall chimneys—coming
into Marseilles, and the train slowed
down and followed one track through many
others into the station. The train stayed twenty-five
minutes in the station at Marseilles and the
American lady bought a copy of <span class='it'>The Daily
Mail</span> and a half-bottle of Evian water. She
walked a little way along the station platform,
but she stayed near the steps of the car because
at Cannes, where it stopped for twelve minutes,
the train had left with no signal of departure
and she had only gotten on just in time. The
American lady was a little deaf and she was
afraid that perhaps signals of departure were
given and that she did not hear them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train left the station in Marseilles and
there was not only the switch-yards and the factory
smoke but, looking back, the town of Marseilles
and the harbor with stone hills behind it
and the last of the sun on the water. As it was
getting dark the train passed a farmhouse burning
in a field. Motor-cars were stopped along
the road and bedding and things from inside the
farmhouse were spread in the field. Many people
were watching the house burn. After it was
dark the train was in Avignon. People got on
and off. At the news-stand Frenchmen, returning
to Paris, bought that day’s French papers.
On the station platform were negro soldiers.
They wore brown uniforms and were tall and
their faces shone, close under the electric light.
Their faces were very black and they were too
tall to stare. The train left Avignon station
with the negroes standing there. A short white
sergeant was with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside the <span class='it'>lit salon</span> compartment the porter
had pulled down the three beds from inside the
wall and prepared them for sleeping. In the
night the American lady lay without sleeping
because the train was a <span class='it'>rapide</span> and went very
fast and she was afraid of the speed in the night.
The American lady’s bed was the one next to
the window. The canary from Palermo, a
cloth spread over his cage, was out of the draft
in the corridor that went into the compartment
wash-room. There was a blue light outside the
compartment, and all night the train went very
fast and the American lady lay awake and
waited for a wreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning the train was near Paris, and
after the American lady had come out from
the wash-room, looking very wholesome and
middle-aged and American in spite of not having
slept, and had taken the cloth off the birdcage
and hung the cage in the sun, she went
back to the restaurant-car for breakfast. When
she came back to the <span class='it'>lit salon</span> compartment
again, the beds had been pushed back into the
wall and made into seats, the canary was shaking
his feathers in the sunlight that came
through the open window, and the train was
much nearer Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He loves the sun,” the American lady said.
“He’ll sing now in a little while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The canary shook his feathers and pecked
into them. “I’ve always loved birds,” the
American lady said. “I’m taking him home to
my little girl. There—he’s singing now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The canary chirped and the feathers on his
throat stood out, then he dropped his bill and
pecked into his feathers again. The train
crossed a river and passed through a very carefully
tended forest. The train passed through
many outside of Paris towns. There were tram-cars
in the towns and big advertisements for the
Belle Jardinière and Dubonnet and Pernod on
the walls toward the train. All that the train
passed through looked as though it were before
breakfast. For several minutes I had not listened
to the American lady, who was talking to
my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your husband American too?” asked the
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said my wife. “We’re both Americans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps that was because I wore braces,” I
said. I had started to say suspenders and
changed it to braces in the mouth, to keep my
English character. The American lady did not
hear. She was really quite deaf; she read lips,
and I had not looked toward her. I had looked
out of the window. She went on talking to my
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad you’re Americans. American
men make the best husbands,” the American
lady was saying. “That was why we left the
Continent, you know. My daughter fell in love
with a man in Vevey.” She stopped. “They
were simply madly in love.” She stopped again.
“I took her away, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she get over it?” asked my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so,” said the American lady.
“She wouldn’t eat anything and she wouldn’t
sleep at all. I’ve tried so very hard, but she
doesn’t seem to take an interest in anything.
She doesn’t care about things. I couldn’t have
her marrying a foreigner.” She paused. “Some
one, a very good friend, told me once, ‘No
foreigner can make an American girl a good
husband.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said my wife, “I suppose not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American lady admired my wife’s travelling-coat,
and it turned out that the American
lady had bought her own clothes for twenty
years now from the same maison de couturier
in the Rue Saint Honoré. They had her measurements,
and a vendeuse who knew her and
her tastes picked the dresses out for her and
they were sent to America. They came to the
post-office near where she lived up-town in New
York, and the duty was never exorbitant because
they opened the dresses there in the post-office
to appraise them and they were always very
simple-looking and with no gold lace nor ornaments
that would make the dresses look expensive.
Before the present vendeuse, named
Thérèse, there had been another vendeuse,
named Amélie. Altogether there had only been
these two in the twenty years. It had always
been the same couturier. Prices, however, had
gone up. The exchange, though, equalized
that. They had her daughter’s measurements
now too. She was grown up and there was not
much chance of their changing now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train was now coming into Paris. The
fortifications were levelled but grass had not
grown. There were many cars standing on tracks—brown
wooden restaurant-cars and brown
wooden sleeping-cars that would go to Italy
at five o’clock that night, if that train still left
at five; the cars were marked Paris-Rome, and
cars, with seats on the roofs, that went back
and forth to the suburbs with, at certain hours,
people in all the seats and on the roofs, if that
were the way it were still done, and passing
were the white walls and many windows of
houses. Nothing had eaten any breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Americans make the best husbands,” the
American lady said to my wife. I was getting
down the bags. “American men are the only
men in the world to marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long ago did you leave Vevey?” asked
my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two years ago this fall. It’s her, you know,
that I’m taking the canary to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the man your daughter was in love
with a Swiss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the American lady. “He was
from a very good family in Vevey. He was going
to be an engineer. They met there in Vevey.
They used to go on long walks together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know Vevey,” said my wife. “We were
there on our honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you really? That must have been
lovely. I had no idea, of course, that she’d fall
in love with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a very lovely place,” said my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the American lady. “Isn’t it
lovely? Where did you stop there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We stayed at the Trois Couronnes,” said
my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s such a fine old hotel,” said the American
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said my wife. “We had a very fine
room and in the fall the country was lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you there in the fall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were passing three cars that had been in
a wreck. They were splintered open and the
roofs sagged in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” I said. “There’s been a wreck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American lady looked and saw the last
car. “I was afraid of just that all night,” she
said. “I have terrific presentiments about things
sometimes. I’ll never travel on a <span class='it'>rapide</span> again
at night. There must be other comfortable
trains that don’t go so fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the train was in the dark of the Gare
de Lyons, and then stopped and porters came up
to the windows. I handed bags through the
windows, and we were out on the dim longness
of the platform, and the American lady put
herself in charge of one of three men from
Cook’s who said: “Just a moment, madame, and
I’ll look for your name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The porter brought a truck and piled on the
baggage, and my wife said good-by and I said
good-by to the American lady, whose name had
been found by the man from Cook’s on a typewritten
page in a sheaf of typewritten pages
which he replaced in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We followed the porter with the truck down
the long cement platform beside the train. At
the end was a gate and a man took the tickets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were returning to Paris to set up separate
residences.</p>

<hr class='pbk'>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>AN ALPINE IDYLL</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was hot coming down into the valley even
in the early morning. The sun melted the snow
from the skis we were carrying and dried the
wood. It was spring in the valley but the sun
was very hot. We came along the road into
Galtur carrying our skis and rucksacks. As we
passed the churchyard a burial was just over. I
said, “Grüss Gott,” to the priest as he walked
past us coming out of the churchyard. The
priest bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s funny a priest never speaks to you,”
John said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d think they’d like to say ‘Grüss
Gott.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They never answer,” John said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stopped in the road and watched the sexton
shovelling in the new earth. A peasant with
a black beard and high leather boots stood beside
the grave. The sexton stopped shovelling
and straightened his back. The peasant in the
high boots took the spade from the sexton and
went on filling in the grave—spreading the earth
evenly as a man spreading manure in a garden.
In the bright May morning the grave-filling
looked unreal. I could not imagine any one
being dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imagine being buried on a day like this,”
I said to John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “we don’t have to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went on up the road past the houses of
the town to the inn. We had been skiing in
the Silvretta for a month, and it was good to
be down in the valley. In the Silvretta the skiing
had been all right, but it was spring skiing,
the snow was good only in the early morning
and again in the evening. The rest of the time
it was spoiled by the sun. We were both tired
of the sun. You could not get away from the
sun. The only shadows were made by rocks
or by the hut that was built under the protection
of a rock beside a glacier, and in the shade
the sweat froze in your underclothing. You
could not sit outside the hut without dark
glasses. It was pleasant to be burned black but
the sun had been very tiring. You could not
rest in it. I was glad to be down away from
snow. It was too late in the spring to be up in
the Silvretta. I was a little tired of skiing.
We had stayed too long. I could taste the snow
water we had been drinking melted off the tin
roof of the hut. The taste was a part of the
way I felt about skiing. I was glad there were
other things beside skiing, and I was glad to
be down, away from the unnatural high mountain
spring, into this May morning in the valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The innkeeper sat on the porch of the inn,
his chair tipped back against the wall. Beside
him sat the cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ski-heil!” said the innkeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heil!” we said and leaned the skis against
the wall and took off our packs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How was it up above?” asked the innkeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Schön. A little too much sun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. There’s too much sun this time of
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cook sat on in his chair. The innkeeper
went in with us and unlocked his office and
brought out our mail. There was a bundle of
letters and some papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get some beer,” John said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. We’ll drink it inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proprietor brought two bottles and we
drank them while we read the letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We better have some more beer,” John said.
A girl brought it this time. She smiled as she
opened the bottles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many letters,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prosit,” she said and went out, taking the
empty bottles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d forgotten what beer tasted like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hadn’t,” John said. “Up in the hut I
used to think about it a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “we’ve got it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You oughtn’t to ever do anything too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. We were up there too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too damn long,” John said. “It’s no good
doing a thing too long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun came through the open window and
shone through the beer bottles on the table.
The bottles were half full. There was a little
froth on the beer in the bottles, not much because
it was very cold. It collared up when
you poured it into the tall glasses. I looked
out of the open window at the white road. The
trees beside the road were dusty. Beyond was
a green field and a stream. There were trees
along the stream and a mill with a water wheel.
Through the open side of the mill I saw a long
log and a saw in it rising and falling. No one
seemed to be tending it. There were four crows
walking in the green field. One crow sat in a
tree watching. Outside on the porch the cook
got off his chair and passed into the hall that led
back into the kitchen. Inside, the sunlight shone
through the empty glasses on the table. John
was leaning forward with his head on his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the window I saw two men come up
the front steps. They came into the drinking
room. One was the bearded peasant in the high
boots. The other was the sexton. They sat
down at the table under the window. The girl
came in and stood by their table. The peasant
did not seem to see her. He sat with his hands
on the table. He wore his old army clothes.
There were patches on the elbows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will it be?” asked the sexton. The
peasant did not pay any attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you drink?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Schnapps,” the peasant said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a quarter litre of red wine,” the sexton
told the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl brought the drinks and the peasant
drank the schnapps. He looked out of the window.
The sexton watched him. John had his
head forward on the table. He was asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The innkeeper came in and went over to the
table. He spoke in dialect and the sexton answered
him. The peasant looked out of the
window. The innkeeper went out of the room.
The peasant stood up. He took a folded ten-thousand
kronen note out of a leather pocket-book
and unfolded it. The girl came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alles?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alles,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me buy the wine,” the sexton said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alles,” the peasant repeated to the girl.
She put her hand in the pocket of her apron,
brought it out full of coins and counted out the
change. The peasant went out the door. As
soon as he was gone the innkeeper came into the
room again and spoke to the sexton. He sat
down at the table. They talked in dialect. The
sexton was amused. The innkeeper was disgusted.
The sexton stood up from the table.
He was a little man with a mustache. He
leaned out of the window and looked up the
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There he goes in,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Löwen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ja.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked again and then the innkeeper
came over to our table. The innkeeper was a tall
man and old. He looked at John asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s pretty tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we were up early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you want to eat soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any time,” I said. “What is there to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything you want. The girl will bring the
eating-card.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl brought the menu. John woke up.
The menu was written in ink on a card and the
card slipped into a wooden paddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the speise-karte,” I said to John.
He looked at it. He was still sleepy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you have a drink with us?” I asked
the innkeeper. He sat down. “Those peasants
are beasts,” said the innkeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We saw that one at a funeral coming into
town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was his wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a beast. All these peasants are beasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t believe it. You wouldn’t believe
what just happened about that one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t believe it.” The innkeeper
spoke to the sexton. “Franz, come over here.”
The sexton came, bringing his little bottle of
wine and his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gentlemen are just come down from
the Wiesbadenerhütte,” the innkeeper said. We
shook hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you drink?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” Franz shook his finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another quarter litre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you understand dialect?” the innkeeper
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s it all about?” John asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going to tell us about the peasant we
saw filling the grave, coming into town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t understand it, anyway,” John said.
“It goes too fast for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That peasant,” the innkeeper said, “to-day
he brought his wife in to be buried. She died
last November.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“December,” said the sexton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes nothing. She died last December
then, and he notified the commune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“December eighteenth,” said the sexton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, he couldn’t bring her over to be
buried until the snow was gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lives on the other side of the Paznaun,”
said the sexton. “But he belongs to this parish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t bring her out at all?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He can only come, from where he
lives, on skis until the snow melts. So to-day he
brought her in to be buried and the priest, when
he looked at her face, didn’t want to bury her.
You go on and tell it,” he said to the sexton.
“Speak German, not dialect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was very funny with the priest,” said the
sexton. “In the report to the commune she died
of heart trouble. We knew she had heart
trouble here. She used to faint in church sometimes.
She did not come for a long time. She
wasn’t strong to climb. When the priest uncovered
her face he asked Olz, ‘Did your wife
suffer much?’ ‘No,’ said Olz. ‘When I came in
the house she was dead across the bed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The priest looked at her again. He didn’t
like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How did her face get that way?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t know,’ Olz said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’d better find out,’ the priest said, and
put the blanket back. Olz didn’t say anything.
The priest looked at him. Olz looked back at
the priest. ‘You want to know?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I must know,’ the priest said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is where it’s good,” the innkeeper said.
“Listen to this. Go on Franz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ said Olz, ‘when she died I made
the report to the commune and I put her in the
shed across the top of the big wood. When I
started to use the big wood she was stiff and I
put her up against the wall. Her mouth was
open and when I came into the shed at night to
cut up the big wood, I hung the lantern from
it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why did you do that?’ asked the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t know,’ said Olz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Did you do that many times?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Every time I went to work in the shed at
night.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It was very wrong,’ said the priest. ‘Did
you love your wife?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ja, I loved her,’ Olz said. ‘I loved her
fine.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you understand it all?” asked the innkeeper.
“You understand it all about his wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about eating?” John asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You order,” I said. “Do you think it’s
true?” I asked the innkeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure it’s true,” he said. “These peasants
are beasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did he go now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone to drink at my colleague’s, the
Löwen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t want to drink with me,” said the
sexton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t want to drink with me, after he
knew about his wife,” said the innkeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” said John. “How about eating?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” I said.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>A PURSUIT RACE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>William Campbell</span> had been in a pursuit
race with a burlesque show ever since Pittsburgh.
In a pursuit race, in bicycle racing,
riders start at equal intervals to ride after one
another. They ride very fast because the race
is usually limited to a short distance and if they
slow their riding another rider who maintains
his pace will make up the space that separated
them equally at the start. As soon as a rider
is caught and passed he is out of the race and
must get down from his bicycle and leave the
track. If none of the riders are caught the
winner of the race is the one who has gained the
most distance. In most pursuit races, if there
are only two riders, one of the riders is caught
inside of six miles. The burlesque show
caught William Campbell at Kansas City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Campbell had hoped to hold a slight
lead over the burlesque show until they reached
the Pacific coast. As long as he preceded the
burlesque show as advance man he was being
paid. When the burlesque show caught up with
him he was in bed. He was in bed when the
manager of the burlesque troupe came into his
room and after the manager had gone out he
decided that he might as well stay in bed. It
was very cold in Kansas City and he was in no
hurry to go out. He did not like Kansas City.
He reached under the bed for a bottle and
drank. It made his stomach feel better. Mr.
Turner, the manager of the burlesque show,
had refused a drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Campbell’s interview with Mr.
Turner had been a little strange. Mr. Turner
had knocked on the door. Campbell had said:
“Come in!” When Mr. Turner came into the
room he saw clothing on a chair, an open suitcase,
the bottle on a chair beside the bed, and
some one lying in the bed completely covered
by the bed-clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mister Campbell,” Mr. Turner said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t fire me,” William Campbell said
from underneath the covers. It was warm and
white and close under the covers. “You can’t
fire me because I’ve got down off my bicycle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re drunk,” Mr. Turner said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” William Campbell said, speaking
directly against the sheet and feeling the texture
with his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a fool,” Mr. Turner said. He
turned off the electric light. The electric light
had been burning all night. It was now ten
o’clock in the morning. “You’re a drunken
fool. When did you get into this town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got into this town last night,” William
Campbell said, speaking against the sheet. He
found he liked to talk through a sheet. “Did
you ever talk through a sheet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try to be funny. You aren’t funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not being funny. I’m just talking
through a sheet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re talking through a sheet all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can go now, Mr. Turner,” Campbell
said. “I don’t work for you any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a lot,” William Campbell said. He
pulled down the sheet and looked at Mr. Turner.
“I know enough so I don’t mind looking
at you at all. Do you want to hear what I
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said William Campbell. “Because
really I don’t know anything at all. I was just
talking.” He pulled the sheet up over his
face again. “I love it under a sheet,” he said.
Mr. Turner stood beside the bed. He was a
middle-aged man with a large stomach and a
bald head and he had many things to do. “You
ought to stop off here, Billy, and take a cure,”
he said. “I’ll fix it up if you want to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to take a cure,” William Campbell
said. “I don’t want to take a cure at all.
I am perfectly happy. All my life I have been
perfectly happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you been this way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a question!” William Campbell
breathed in and out through the sheet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you been stewed, Billy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I done my work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. I just asked you how long you’ve
been stewed, Billy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. But I’ve got my wolf back,”
he touched the sheet with his tongue. “I’ve had
him for a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hell you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. My dear wolf. Every time I take
a drink he goes outside the room. He can’t
stand alcohol. The poor little fellow.” He
moved his tongue round and round on the sheet.
“He’s a lovely wolf. He’s just like he always
was.” William Campbell shut his eyes and
took a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got to take a cure, Billy,” Mr. Turner
said. “You won’t mind the Keeley. It isn’t
bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Keeley,” William Campbell said. “It
isn’t far from London.” He shut his eyes and
opened them, moving the eyelashes against the
sheet. “I just love sheets,” he said. He looked
at Mr. Turner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, you think I’m drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>are</span> drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re drunk and you’ve had dt’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” William Campbell held the sheet
around his head. “Dear sheet,” he said. He
breathed against it gently. “Pretty sheet. You
love me, don’t you, sheet? It’s all in the price
of the room. Just like in Japan. No,” he
said. “Listen Billy, dear Sliding Billy, I have
a surprise for you. I’m not drunk. I’m hopped
to the eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Mr. Turner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a look.” William Campbell pulled
up the right sleeve of his pyjama jacket under
the sheet, then shoved the right forearm out.
“Look at that.” On the forearm, from just
above the wrist to the elbow, were small blue
circles around tiny dark blue punctures. The
circles almost touched one another. “That’s
the new development,” William Campbell said.
“I drink a little now once in a while, just to
drive the wolf out of the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They got a cure for that, ‘Sliding Billy’ ”
Turner said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” William Campbell said. “They
haven’t got a cure for anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t just quit like that, Billy,” Turner
said. He sat on the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be careful of my sheet,” William Campbell
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t just quit at your age and take to
pumping yourself full of that stuff just because
you got in a jam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a law against it. If that’s what you
mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I mean you got to fight it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Billy Campbell caressed the sheet with his
lips and his tongue. “Dear sheet,” he said. “I
can kiss this sheet and see right through it at the
same time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut it out about the sheet. You can’t just
take to that stuff, Billy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Campbell shut his eyes. He was
beginning to feel a slight nausea. He knew
that this nausea would increase steadily, without
there ever being the relief of sickness, until
something were done against it. It was at this
point that he suggested that Mr. Turner have
a drink. Mr. Turner declined. William Campbell
took a drink from the bottle. It was a temporary
measure. Mr. Turner watched him.
Mr. Turner had been in this room much longer
than he should have been, he had many things
to do; although living in daily association with
people who used drugs, he had a horror of
drugs, and he was very fond of William Campbell;
he did not wish to leave him. He was
very sorry for him and he felt a cure might
help. He knew there were good cures in Kansas
City. But he had to go. He stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, Billy,” William Campbell said, “I
want to tell you something. You’re called ‘Sliding
Billy.’ That’s because you can slide. I’m
called just Billy. That’s because I never could
slide at all. I can’t slide, Billy. I can’t slide.
It just catches. Every time I try it, it catches.”
He shut his eyes. “I can’t slide, Billy. It’s
awful when you can’t slide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said “Sliding Billy” Turner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, what?” William Campbell looked at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were saying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said William Campbell. “I wasn’t
saying. It must have been a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were saying about sliding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It couldn’t have been about sliding.
But listen, Billy, and I’ll tell you a secret. Stick
to sheets, Billy. Keep away from women and
horses and, and—” he stopped “—eagles, Billy.
If you love horses you’ll get horse-s—, and if
you love eagles you’ll get eagle-s—.” He
stopped and put his head under the sheet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got to go,” said “Sliding Billy” Turner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you love women you’ll get a dose,” William
Campbell said. “If you love horses——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you said that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Said what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About horses and eagles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. And if you love sheets.” He
breathed on the sheet and stroked his nose
against it. “I don’t know about sheets,” he said.
“I just started to love this sheet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to go,” Mr. Turner said. “I got
a lot to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” William Campbell said.
“Everybody’s got to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I better go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you all right, Billy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was never so happy in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m fine. You go along. I’ll just lie here
for a little while. Around noon I’ll get up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Mr. Turner came up to William
Campbell’s room at noon William Campbell
was sleeping and as Mr. Turner was a man who
knew what things in life were very valuable he
did not wake him.</p>

Men and boys bought full-length colored pictures

<div><h1 id='ch14'>NOW I LAY ME</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>That</span> night we lay on the floor in the room
and I listened to the silk-worms eating. The
silk-worms fed in racks of mulberry leaves and
all night you could hear them eating and a
dropping sound in the leaves. I myself did
not want to sleep because I had been living for
a long time with the knowledge that if I ever
shut my eyes in the dark and let myself go, my
soul would go out of my body. I had been that
way for a long time, ever since I had been blown
up at night and felt it go out of me and go off
and then come back. I tried never to think
about it, but it had started to go since, in the
nights, just at the moment of going off to sleep,
and I could only stop it by a very great effort.
So while now I am fairly sure that it would not
really have gone out, yet then, that summer, I
was unwilling to make the experiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had different ways of occupying myself
while I lay awake. I would think of a trout
stream I had fished along when I was a boy and
fish its whole length very carefully in my mind;
fishing very carefully under all the logs, all the
turns of the bank, the deep holes and the clear
shallow stretches, sometimes catching trout and
sometimes losing them. I would stop fishing
at noon to eat my lunch; sometimes on a log
over the stream; sometimes on a high bank
under a tree, and I always ate my lunch very
slowly and watched the stream below me while
I ate. Often I ran out of bait because I would
take only ten worms with me in a tobacco tin
when I started. When I had used them all I
had to find more worms, and sometimes it was
very difficult digging in the bank of the stream
where the cedar trees kept out the sun and
there was no grass but only the bare moist earth
and often I could find no worms. Always
though I found some kind of bait, but one time
in the swamp I could find no bait at all and had
to cut up one of the trout I had caught and use
him for bait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes I found insects in the swamp
meadows, in the grass or under ferns, and used
them. There were beetles and insects with legs
like grass stems, and grubs in old rotten logs;
white grubs with brown pinching heads that
would not stay on the hook and emptied into
nothing in the cold water, and wood ticks under
logs where sometimes I found angle-worms that
slipped into the ground as soon as the log was
raised. Once I used a salamander from under
an old log. The salamander was very small and
neat and agile and a lovely color. He had tiny
feet that tried to hold on to the hook, and after
that one time I never used a salamander, although
I found them very often. Nor did
I use crickets, because of the way they acted
about the hook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes the stream ran through an open
meadow, and in the dry grass I would catch
grasshoppers and use them for bait and sometimes
I would catch grasshoppers and toss them
into the stream and watch them float along
swimming on the stream and circling on the
surface as the current took them and then disappear
as a trout rose. Sometimes I would fish
four or five different streams in the night;
starting as near as I could get to their source
and fishing them down stream. When I had
finished too quickly and the time did not go,
I would fish the stream over again, starting
where it emptied into the lake and fishing back
up stream, trying for all the trout I had missed
coming down. Some nights too I made up
streams, and some of them were very exciting,
and it was like being awake and dreaming.
Some of those streams I still remember and
think that I have fished in them, and they are
confused with streams I really know. I gave
them all names and went to them on the train
and sometimes walked for miles to get to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But some nights I could not fish, and on those
nights I was cold-awake and said my prayers
over and over and tried to pray for all the people
I had ever known. That took up a great
amount of time, for if you try to remember all
the people you have ever known, going back
to the earliest thing you remember—which was,
with me, the attic of the house where I was
born and my mother and father’s wedding-cake
in a tin box hanging from one of the rafters,
and, in the attic, jars of snakes and other specimens
that my father had collected as a boy and
preserved in alcohol, the alcohol sunken in the
jars so the backs of some of the snakes and
specimens were exposed and had turned white—if
you thought back that far, you remembered a
great many people. If you prayed for all of
them, saying a Hail Mary and an Our Father
for each one, it took a long time and finally it
would be light, and then you could go to sleep,
if you were in a place where you could sleep
in the daylight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On those nights I tried to remember everything
that had ever happened to me, starting
with just before I went to the war and remembering
back from one thing to another. I found
I could only remember back to that attic in my
grandfather’s house. Then I would start there
and remember this way again, until I reached
the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remembered, after my grandfather died we
moved away from that house and to a new
house designed and built by my mother. Many
things that were not to be moved were burned
in the back-yard and I remember those jars
from the attic being thrown in the fire, and
how they popped in the heat and the fire flamed
up from the alcohol. I remember the snakes
burning in the fire in the back-yard. But there
were no people in that, only things. I could not
remember who burned the things even, and I
would go on until I came to people and then
stop and pray for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the new house I remembered how my
mother was always cleaning things out and making
a good clearance. One time when my father
was away on a hunting trip she made a good
thorough cleaning out in the basement and
burned everything that should not have been
there. When my father came home and got
down from his buggy and hitched the horse, the
fire was still burning in the road beside the
house. I went out to meet him. He handed
me his shotgun and looked at the fire. “What’s
this?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been cleaning out the basement, dear,”
my mother said from the porch. She was
standing there smiling, to meet him. My father
looked at the fire and kicked at something.
Then he leaned over and picked something out
of the ashes. “Get a rake, Nick,” he said to
me. I went to the basement and brought a rake
and my father raked very carefully in the ashes.
He raked out stone axes and stone skinning
knives and tools for making arrow-heads and
pieces of pottery and many arrow-heads. They
had all been blackened and chipped by the fire.
My father raked them all out very carefully
and spread them on the grass by the road. His
shotgun in its leather case and his game-bags
were on the grass where he had left them when
he stepped down from the buggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the gun and the bags in the house,
Nick, and bring me a paper,” he said. My
mother had gone inside the house. I took the
shotgun, which was heavy to carry and banged
against my legs, and the two game-bags and
started toward the house. “Take them one at
a time,” my father said. “Don’t try and carry
too much at once.” I put down the game-bags
and took in the shotgun and brought out a newspaper
from the pile in my father’s office. My
father spread all the blackened, chipped stone
implements on the paper and then wrapped
them up. “The best arrow-heads went all to
pieces,” he said. He walked into the house with
the paper package and I stayed outside on the
grass with the two game-bags. After a while I
took them in. In remembering that, there were
only two people, so I would pray for them both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some nights, though, I could not remember
my prayers even. I could only get as far as
“On earth as it is in heaven” and then have to
start all over and be absolutely unable to get
past that. Then I would have to recognize that
I could not remember and give up saying my
prayers that night and try something else. So
on some nights I would try to remember all the
animals in the world by name and then the birds
and then fishes and then countries and cities and
then kinds of food and the names of all the
streets I could remember in Chicago, and when
I could not remember anything at all any more
I would just listen. And I do not remember a
night on which you could not hear things. If
I could have a light I was not afraid to sleep,
because I knew my soul would only go out of
me if it were dark. So, of course, many nights
I was where I could have a light and then I
slept because I was nearly always tired and
often very sleepy. And I am sure many times
too that I slept without knowing it—but I never
slept knowing it, and on this night I listened to
the silk-worms. You can hear silk-worms eating
very clearly in the night and I lay with my eyes
open and listened to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one other person in the room
and he was awake too. I listened to him being
awake, for a long time. He could not lie as
quietly as I could because, perhaps, he had not
had as much practice being awake. We were
lying on blankets spread over straw and when he
moved the straw was noisy, but the silk-worms
were not frightened by any noise we made and
ate on steadily. There were the noises of night
seven kilometres behind the lines outside but
they were different from the small noises inside
the room in the dark. The other man in the
room tried lying quietly. Then he moved
again. I moved too, so he would know I was
awake. He had lived ten years in Chicago.
They had taken him for a soldier in nineteen
fourteen when he had come back to visit his
family, and they had given him to me for an
orderly because he spoke English. I heard him
listening, so I moved again in the blankets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you sleep, Signor Tenente?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t sleep, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I can’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You feel all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. I feel good. I just can’t sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to talk a while?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. What can you talk about in this damn
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This place is pretty good,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” he said. “It’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about out in Chicago,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he said, “I told you all that once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about how you got married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was the letter you got Monday—from
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. She writes me all the time. She’s
making good money with the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have a nice place when you go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. She runs it fine. She’s making a lot
of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think we’ll wake them up, talking?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. They can’t hear. Anyway, they sleep
like pigs. I’m different,” he said. “I’m nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talk quiet,” I said. “Want a smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We smoked skilfully in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t smoke much, Signor Tenente.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I’ve just about cut it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “it don’t do you any good
and I suppose you get so you don’t miss it. Did
you ever hear a blind man won’t smoke because
he can’t see the smoke come out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s all bull, myself,” he said. “I
just heard it somewhere. You know how you
hear things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were both quiet and I listened to the silk-worms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hear those damn silk-worms?” he
asked. “You can hear them chew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s funny,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Signor Tenente, is there something
really the matter that you can’t sleep? I never
see you sleep. You haven’t slept nights ever
since I been with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, John,” I said. “I got in pretty
bad shape along early last spring and at night it
bothers me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just like I am,” he said. “I shouldn’t have
ever got in this war. I’m too nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it will get better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Signor Tenente, what did you get in
this war for, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, John. I wanted to, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wanted to,” he said. “That’s a hell of a
reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We oughtn’t to talk out loud,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They sleep just like pigs,” he said. “They
can’t understand the English language, anyway.
They don’t know a damn thing. What are you
going to do when it’s over and we go back to the
States?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get a job on a paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Chicago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you ever read what this fellow Brisbane
writes? My wife cuts it out for me and sends it
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever meet him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I’ve seen him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to meet that fellow. He’s a fine
writer. My wife don’t read English but she
takes the paper just like when I was home and
she cuts out the editorials and the sport page
and sends them to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are your kids?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re fine. One of the girls is in the
fourth grade now. You know, Signor Tenente,
if I didn’t have the kids I wouldn’t be your
orderly now. They’d have made me stay in the
line all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’ve got them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I. They’re fine kids but I want a
boy. Three girls and no boy. That’s a hell
of a note.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you try and go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t sleep now. I’m wide awake
now, Signor Tenente. Say, I’m worried about
you not sleeping though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be all right, John.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imagine a young fellow like you not to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get all right. It just takes a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got to get all right. A man can’t get
along that don’t sleep. Do you worry about
anything? You got anything on your mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, John, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to get married, Signor Tenente.
Then you wouldn’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to get married. Why don’t you
pick out some nice Italian girl with plenty of
money. You could get any one you want.
You’re young and you got good decorations and
you look nice. You been wounded a couple of
times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t talk the language well enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk it fine. To hell with talking the
language. You don’t have to talk to them.
Marry them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll think about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know some girls, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you marry the one with the most
money. Over here, the way they’re brought
up, they’ll all make you a good wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll think about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think about it, Signor Tenente. Do
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man ought to be married. You’ll never
regret it. Every man ought to be married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” I said. “Let’s try and sleep a
while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Signor Tenente. I’ll try it again.
But you remember what I said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll remember it,” I said. “Now let’s sleep
a while, John.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said. “I hope you sleep,
Signor Tenente.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard him roll in his blankets on the straw
and then he was very quiet and I listened to him
breathing regularly. Then he started to snore.
I listened to him snore for a long time and then
I stopped listening to him snore and listened to
the silk-worms eating. They ate steadily, making
a dropping in the leaves. I had a new
thing to think about and I lay in the dark with
my eyes open and thought of all the girls I had
ever known and what kind of wives they would
make. It was a very interesting thing to think
about and for a while it killed off trout-fishing
and interfered with my prayers. Finally,
though, I went back to trout-fishing, because I
found that I could remember all the streams
and there was always something new about
them, while the girls, after I had thought about
them a few times, blurred and I could not call
them into my mind and finally they all blurred
and all became rather the same and I gave up
thinking about them almost altogether. But I
kept on with my prayers and I prayed very
often for John in the nights and his class was
removed from active service before the October
offensive. I was glad he was not there, because
he would have been a great worry to me.
He came to the hospital in Milan to see me several
months after and was very disappointed
that I had not yet married, and I know he
would feel very badly if he knew that, so far,
I have never married. He was going back to
America and he was very certain about marriage
and knew it would fix up everything.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
